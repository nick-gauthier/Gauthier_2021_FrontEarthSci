abstract = {Least-cost modelling and circuit theory are common analogs used in ecology and evolution to model gene flow or animal movement across landscapes. Least-cost modelling estimates the least-cost distance, whereas circuit theory estimates resistance distance. The bias added in choosing one method over the other has not been well documented. We designed an experiment to test whether both methods were linearly related. We also tested the sensitivity of these metrics to variation in Euclidean distance, spatial autocorrelation, the number of pixels representing the landscape, and data aggregation. We found that least-cost and resistance distance were not linearly related unless a transformation was applied. Resistance distance was less sensitive to the number of pixels representing a landscape and was also less sensitive than least-cost distance to the Euclidean distance between nodes. Spatial autocorrelation did not affect either method or the relationship between methods. Resistance distance was more sensitive to aggregation in any form compared to least-cost distance. Therefore, the metric used to infer movement or gene flow and the manipulations applied to the data used to calculate these metrics may govern findings.},

abstract = {This paper traces the phenomenon of polis desertion, exploring both its causes and its impact on the social and political landscape. It is argued that while the Greek poleis were highly vulnerable to ecologically and socially induced stress and catastrophe, they were at the same time remarkably resilient in a way that their individual inhabitants could not be. It is argued that this social resilience was a product of relations with other communities which served as a kind of buffer against risk; it is thus the communal response to stress and catastrophe that enables social resilience. A variety of relations between communities contributed to social resilience, including kinship, sympoliteia, and isopoliteia, but it is argued that the koinon was the most effective social structure in achieving this end, by institutionalizing economic and political relations between communities that allowed for diversification and redistribution of both populations and resources. In writing the history of abandonment in the Classical and Hellenistic poleis, evidence is drawn from literary and epigraphic sources as well as intensive and extensive survey, excavation and studies of landscape change in antiquity.},

abstract = {In agrarian societies, such as the ancestral Pueblo of the Four Corners region of the US Southwest (c. AD 600–1300), the resilience of crops in the face of climate challenges was of paramount concern. Consequently, students of these societies have invested much effort in modeling the response of traditional crops to ancient weather patterns. Less effort has been made to evaluate the quality of those reconstructions with experimental studies. Here, we report on results from the Pueblo Farming Project (PFP), a long-term collaboration between the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center and the Hopi tribe. From 2009 through 2015, PFP researchers and members of the Hopi tribe planted four experimental gardens of Hopi maize (Zea mays) on Crow Canyon's campus in southwestern Colorado using traditional methods. PFP researchers recorded growth progress over the growing season, harvested the corn, measured characteristics of the resulting crop, and derived yield estimates. We present the results of the garden experiments and we compare experimental yields with computational estimates of potential maize yield developed by the Village Ecodynamics Project (VEP). We find that Hopi maize flourishes in this part of the Hopi ancestral land and that PFP experimental yields are highly correlated with VEP yield estimates. We suggest that these PFP data may be used to refine existing maize paleoproductivity estimates, and we propose future directions for farming experiments in the Four Corners.},

abstract = {Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is a powerful tool for data compression and dimensionality reduction used broadly in meteorology and oceanography. Often in the literature. EOF modes are interpreted individually, independent of other modes. In fact, it can be shown that no such attribution can generally be made. This review demonstrates that in general individual EOF modes (i) will not correspond to individual dynamical modes, (ii) will not correspond to individual kinematic degrees of freedom, (iii) will not be sta­ tistically independent of other EOF modes, and (iv) will be strongly influenced by the nonlocal requirement that modes maximize variance over the entire domain. The goal of this review is not to argue against the use of EOF analysis in meteorology and oceanography; rather, it is to demonstrate the care that must be taken in the interpretation of individual modes in order to distinguish the medium from the message.},

abstract = {The article explores the strategies employed by smallholder farmers in Mexico to cope with the affects of climatic variability, and how seasonal climate forecasts may assist these farmers in mitigating climatic risk. Recognizing that the decisions of smallholder farmers are intricately tied to the political-economic circumstances in which they operate, the article discusses how agricultural policy in Mexico affects the vulnerability of small-scale producers and may inhibit their ability to use climatic forecasts to their advantage. The article first reviews the literature on smallholder adaptation in Mexico, and discusses briefly policy and institutional issues affecting adaptation at the farm-level. Using the case of small-scale maize producers in Tlaxcala, Mexico, as an illustration, the article then argues that political-economic uncertainty outweighs climatic variability as a determinant of the production strategies of small-scale producers. In these circumstances, the farmers are unlikely to use new seasonal climate forecasts},

@article{Weiss1982,
abstract = {The disintegration of Eastern Mediterranean civilization at the end of the late Bronze Age (late thirteenth and twelfth centuries B.C.) has traditionally been attributed to the irruption of new peoples into this area. However, the nearly contemporaneous decline of highly organized and powerful states in Greece, Anatolia, Egypt, and Mesopotamia warrants consideration of possible environ- mental causes likely to operate over sizable areas, especially since archaeological research has not succeeded in establishing the presence of newcomers at the onset of the Bronze Age disturbances. Climatic change is a particularly attractive candidate since temperature and precipitation variations persisting over relatively short times can adversely affect agricultural output. Carpenter (1966) argued that the Mycenaean decline and migrations in and from Greece in the late thirteenth century were caused by prolonged drought and not the incursion of less civilized Dorian tribes. Donley (1971) and Bryson et al. (1974) have presented evidence of a spatial drought pattern which occurred in January 1955 that might be invoked to support this thesis. Population movements in Anatolia at the same time, though not as well established, can be delimited to some degree by the distribution of Hitto-Luwian peoples in the late ninth century B.C. It is hypothesized here that a drought induced migration of Luwian peoples from Western Antolia occurred early in the twelfth century B.C., that it was associated in some fashion with the invasion of Egypt by the 'Sea Peoples' in the reign of Ramesses III, and that the defeated remnants of these peoples settled along the Levantine coast and filtered into North Syria and the upper Euphrates valley. It has been suggested that past climatic patterns recur in the present epoch but with a possibly different frequency. To establish that a spatial drought analogue to the above hypothesized migration can occur, temperature and pre- cipitation records from 35 Greek, Turkish, Cypriot, and Syrian weather stations for the period 1951-1976 were examined. The Palmer drought index, an empiri- cal method of measuring drought severity, was computed for each of these stations for the period of record. Since wheat yields tend to be highly correlated with winter precipitation for the area in question, the drought indices for the winter months were subjected to an empirical eigenvector analysis. An eigenvector (drought pattern) consistent with the postulated population movements in Anato- lia occurred within the modem climatological record and was found to have been the dominant pattern in January 1972. The potential problems of eigenvector analysis in investigating problems of this type are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper presents an agent-based complex system simulation of settlement structure change using methods derived from entropy maximization modeling. The approach is applied to model the movement of people and goods in urban settings to study how settlement size hierarchy develops. While entropy maximization is well known for assessing settlement structure change over different spatiotemporal settings, approaches have rarely attempted to develop and apply this methodology to understand how individual and household decisions may affect settlement size distributions. A new method developed in this paper allows individual decision-makers to chose where to settle based on social-environmental factors, evaluate settlements based on geography and relative benefits, while retaining concepts derived from entropy maximization with settlement size affected by movement ability and site attractiveness feedbacks. To demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical and methodological approach, case study settlement patterns from the Middle Bronze (MBA) and Iron Ages (IA) in the Iraqi North Jazirah Survey (NJS) are used. Results indicate clear differences in settlement factors and household choices in simulations that lead to settlement size hierarchies comparable to the two evaluated periods. Conflict and socio-political cohesion, both their presence and absence, are suggested to have major roles in affecting the observed settlement hierarchy. More broadly, the model is made applicable for different empirically based settings, while being generalized to incorporate data uncertainty, making the model useful for understanding urbanism from top-down and bottom-up perspectives.},

abstract = {One clear trend that can be discerned in the last 15 years of otherwise-rather-protean Southwestern archaeology is a growing recognition that at any given time, demographic productive, and organizational strategies can be quite variable, even within comparatively small regions; that these strategies could change quickly and in ways that are not easily predictable through some linear model of process; and that there was perhaps a greater amount of expedient behavior implied by these kinds of variability that had previously been acknowledged (see, for example, Cordell and Plog 1979). This recognition, perhaps, is part of the process of normal science, which first emphasizes understanding the most obvious patterns in time and space---as exemplified for the Anasazi by the Pecos classification---and only then, on understanding the reasons for the variablity that remains, unexplained and initially even undescribed, around those modes. In any case, we have moved from an almost complete focus on mean, or normative, behavior to a greater concern with variability around those norms.},

abstract = {The "Dust Bowl" drought of the 1930s was highly unusual for North America, deviating from the typical pattern forced by "La Nina" with the maximum drying in the central and northern Plains, warm temperature anomalies across almost the entire continent, and widespread dust storms. General circulation models (GCMs), forced by sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from the 1930s, produce a drought, but one that is centered in southwestern North America and without the warming centered in the middle of the continent. Here, we show that the inclusion of forcing from human land degradation during the period, in addition to the anomalous SSTs, is necessary to reproduce the anomalous features of the Dust Bowl drought. The degradation over the Great Plains is represented in the GCM as a reduction in vegetation cover and the addition of a soil dust aerosol source, both consequences of crop failure. As a result of land surface feedbacks, the simulation of the drought is much improved when the new dust aerosol and vegetation boundary conditions are included. Vegetation reductions explain the high temperature anomaly over the northern U.S., and the dust aerosols intensify the drought and move it northward of the purely ocean-forced drought pattern. When both factors are included in the model simulations, the precipitation and temperature anomalies are of similar magnitude and in a similar location compared with the observations. Human-induced land degradation is likely to have not only contributed to the dust storms of the 1930s but also amplified the drought, and these together turned a modest SST-forced drought into one of the worst environmental disasters the U.S. has experienced.},

abstract = {We compare the robustness of food supplies to annual variation in rainfall within two different agricultural systems: a generalist system with one type of agent who cultivates both maize and agave, and a specialist system composed of two types of agents who cultivate either maize or agave and are able to exchange. When mean rainfall is relatively high and less variable or relatively low and more variable, food supplies in the specialist system are more robust than in the generalist system. However, at intermediate levels of mean rainfall and variability, food supplies in the specialist system are less robust than those in the generalist system. Our analysis suggests that conflicts of interest and their associated costs constrain the development of specialization in some environments. When considering the robustness of social-ecological systems, it is important to consider “for whom a coupled social and ecological system is robust?”},

"Finally, by treating U T as a parameter, we assume that the total area that farmers devote to a particular crop (a decision based on many years of accumulated experience) changes more slowly than the choices that a farmer makes about the amount of maize or agave to gift on an annual basis (a decision based on annual rainfall variation)." (p. 299)
"The rainfall-productivity function does not consider how too much water would impact the productivity of maize" (p. 300)
"As a perennial plant, an agave population will exhibit age structure with individuals distributed across different cohorts." (p. 300)
they use density dependent growth for agave. should we do the same for sheep? (note on p.300)
 
"The exchange dynamics in our model system occur in a social market (Fiske 1992 ) as opposed to a monetized market (Heyman and Ariely 2004 ). The logic of exchange in social markets is often based on ritual and kin-based obligations rather than maximizing profit per se (Henrich et al . 2004 ; Sahlins 1972 ; Mauss 2006 )" (p. 300)
"A famine event of length i is simply the number of consecutive years when the minimum level of food required by a given representative agent is not achieved." (p. 302)
"When robustness is assessed in terms of discrete famine events, the food supply of the agave specialists is less vulnerable than the food supply of the generalist and maize specialists for all levels of mean rainfall. Maize specialists, on the other hand, experience more famine events than the generalist, except when mean rainfall drops to 55 units. At first glance, these results suggest that specialization provides a big advantage for agave specialists, but giving up their direct access to maize results in a subtle vulnerability." (p. 303)
"The agave specialists reduce their total famine events by eating excess agave in good years and storing their gifted maize. This strategy buffers the agave specialists against occasional dry years that wipe out juvenile cohorts of agave; however, the potential exists for dry years to occur consecutively causing successive cohorts of agave to fail. Under these conditions, agave yields may drop to zero for a decade at a time and agave specialists experience, on average, a large number of total famine years. This means that over an average 100-year time interval, the agave specialists spend almost a third of the time (31.1 years) in famine, even when mean rainfall is 100 units! By specializing, the agave specialists trade-off robustness to frequent, small deficits in rainfall for extreme vulnerability to less frequent, large deficits in rainfall." (p. 303)
"can food preferences be easily redefined, or are they entrenched by high social or physiological costs?" (p. 303)
"The solution that maximizes robustness for the group as a whole does not necessarily confer equal advantages to all group members." (p. 305)
"Our comparison of models indicates that in some social-ec ological conditions a specialized system with exchange outperform s a generalist system, in terms of the robustness of farmers ' supply of food to variation in rainfall." (p. 306)
"These observations suggest that to increase their robustness to famine, farmers in productive and less variable environments or extremely variable and unproductive environments should adopt a specialist strategy rather than be generalists." (p. 306)
"Our results are consistent with the long known pattern in ecology that specialization is more common in productive and less variable environments (Pianka 1973 )." (p. 306)
"We hypothesize that social diversity based on specialization and exchange may be constrained in environments where the production of resources is highly uncertain or unproductive due to the emergence of conflicts of interest between social actors." (p. 306)
"Cashdan ( 2001 ) has suggested that in subsistence-oriented human economies, the formation of specialization and exchange systems may occur in association with ethnic distinctions. For example, she has observed a negative correlation between ethnic diversity and inter-annual variation in rainfall, which could be explained by the emergence of conflicts of interest between members of different ethnic groups, or, as in our analysis, potential specialists, in uncertain environments." (p. 306)
"Thus, one hypothesis is that an agricultural economy based on specialization in maize and agave is more limited by inter-annual deviations in precipitation than the mean amount of precipitation. If a specialist system developed along the northern frontier and then climate shifted, even slightly increasing inter-annual variability in rainfall, this change would have strained the social relationships necessary for a specialist syste m to operate and possibly lead to a trajectory of social dissolution. Alternatively, it could trigger social tactics to coerce specialists to continue planting crops in ratios that were not in the interests of some farmers." (p. 307)
"Irrigation, however, provides an advantage in semi-arid environments by boosting the reliability of harvest (Mabry 2005 ). Thus, the addition of irrigation could significantly improve the robustness of the maize specialists ' food supply to drought. It is interesting, therefore, to note that irrigation ditches are evidenced in the Malpaso Valley floodplain near the site of La Quemada (Elliott et al . 2010 ). The irrigation of maize and specialization in agave production may go hand-in-hand because a sufficient degree of reliability in maize production is necessary for a specialist system to function" (p. 307)
"Parsons ( 2010 ), in fact, suggests that the expansion of traditional Mesoamerican life-ways into the northern frontier may have been driven by economic specialization in the production of agave and the exchange of agave products, especially for productive lake-zone resources from the central Mexican highlands" (p. 307)
"The production of textiles, in particular, could provide agave specialists with a durable good that has trade value apart from the starchy heart used for food. Thus, textiles and other durable-good agave products could be exchanged for food during times of need. In productive, but highly variable environments, agave specialists may be able to reduce their exposure to dry periods that produce long famines by producing textiles for trade. Even if agave hearts failed as a direct food source, stored textiles might be used to acquire food" (p. 307)

abstract = {Two major traditions coexist in the statistical analysis of spatial and social change: mobility analysis (e.g. Boudon 1973; Bartholomew 1982) initiated by Prais (1953) on one hand, and gravity modelling for geographic flows (e.g. Fother- ingham and O'Kelly 1989; Sen and Smith 1995), initiated by Reilly (1931) on the other hand. This paper focuses on the formal content of both traditions and ex- plores their relationship. Three small data sets (migrations, occupational mobility and opinion shifts) illustrate the issues. In particular, we show how the sojourn times and jump matrices of mobility analysis are related to the accessibilities and expan- sivities of gravity modelling.We also address in detail the issues of time-dependence and categories aggregation. Two well-behaved indices of mobility are defined and discussed, namely the average sojourn time, which measures short-time mobility, and the second eigenvalue of the transition matrix measuring long-time mobility.},

@article{Reynolds2003,
abstract = {The initial version of the model used in this study, Village 1.0, was implemented by Tim Kohler and a team of developers mostly from Washington State University. The original model addressed environmental constraints only and did not attempt to model social interaction. In a recent paper we employed Cultural Algorithms as a framework in which to add selected social considerations. In this paper we extend our previous model by adding the ability of agents to perform symmetrically initiated or asymmetrically initiated generalized reciprocal exchange. We have developed a state model for agents' knowledge and, given agents' different responses based on this knowledge. Experiments have shown that the network structure of the systems without reciprocity was the simplest but least resilient. As we allowed agents more opportunities to exchange resources we produced more complex network structures, larger populations, and more resilient systems. Furthermore, allowing the agents to buffer their requests by using a finite state model improved the relative resilience of these larger systems. Introducing reciprocity that can be triggered by both requestors and donors produced the largest number of successful donations. This represents the synergy produced by using the information from two complementary situations within the network. Thus, the network has more information with which it can work and tended to be more resilient than otherwise.},

abstract = {AbstractThe western United States was affected by several megadroughts during the last 1200 years, most prominently during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA: 800 to 1300 CE). A null hypothesis is developed to test the possibility that, given a sufficiently long period of time, these events are inevitable and occur purely as a consequence of internal climate variability. The null distribution of this hypothesis is populated by a linear inverse model (LIM) constructed from global sea-surface temperature anomalies and self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index data for North America. Despite being trained only on seasonal data from the late 20th century, the LIM produces megadroughts that are comparable in their duration, spatial scale, and magnitude as the most severe events of the last 12 centuries. The null hypothesis therefore cannot be rejected with much confidence when considering these features of megadrought, meaning that similar events are possible today, even without any changes to boundary cond...},

abstract = {Drought is the most economically expensive recurring natural disaster to strike North America in modern times. Recently available gridded drought reconstructions have been developed for most of North America from a network of drought-sensitive tree-ring chronologies, many of which span the last 1000 yr. These reconstructions enable the authors to Put the famous droughts of the instrumental record (i.e., the 1930s Dust Bowl and the 1950s Southwest droughts) into the context of 1000 yr of natural drought variability oil the continent. We can now, with this remarkable new record, examine the severity, persistence, spatial signatures, and frequencies of drought variability over the past milllenmum. and how these have changed with time.The gridded drought reconstructions reveal the existence of successive "megadroughts." unprecedented in persistence (20-40 yr). yet similar in year-to-year severity and spatial distribution to the major droughts experienced in today{\&}apos;s North America. These megadroughts occurred during a 400-yr-long period in the early to middle second millennium A.D., with a climate varying as today{\&}apos;s, but around a drier mean. The implication is that the mechanism forcing persistent drought in the West and the Plains in the instrumental era is analagous to that underlying the megadroughts of the medieval period. The leading spatial mode of drought variability in the recontructions resembles the North American ENSO pattern: widespread drought across the United States. centered On file Southwest, with a hint of the opposite phase in the Pacific Northwest.Recently, climate models forced by the observed history of tropical Pacific SSTs have been able to successfully simulate all of the major North American droughts of the last 150 yr. In each case, cool "La Nina-like" conditions in the tropical Pacific arc consistent with North American drought. With ENSO showing a Pronounced signal in the gridded drought recontructions of the last millennium. both in terms of its link to the leading spatial mode, and the leading time scales of drought variability (revealed by multitaper spectral analysis and wavelet analysis), it is postulated that, as for the modern clay, the medieval megadroughts were forced by protracted La Nina-like tropical Pacific SSTs. Further evidence for this comes from the global hydroclimatic "footprint" of the medieval era revealed by existing paleoclimatic archives from the tropical Pacific and ENSO-sensitive tropical and extratropical land regions. In general, this global pattern matches that observed for modern-day persistent North American drought, whereby a La Nina-like tropical Pacific is accompanied by hemispheric, and in the midlatitudes, zonal, symmetry of hydroclimatic anomalies.},

abstract = {Many real-world networks tend to be very dense. Particular examples of interest arise in the construction of networks that represent pairwise similarities between objects. In these cases, the networks under consideration are weighted, generally with positive weights between any two nodes. Visualization and analysis of such networks, especially when the number of nodes is large, can pose significant challenges which are often met by reducing the edge set. Any effective "sparsification" must retain and reflect the important structure in the network. A common method is to simply apply a hard threshold, keeping only those edges whose weight exceeds some predetermined value. A more principled approach is to extract the multiscale "backbone" of a network by retaining statistically significant edges through hypothesis testing on a specific null model, or by appropriately transforming the original weight matrix before applying some sort of threshold. Unfortunately, approaches such as these can fail to capture multiscale structure in which there can be small but locally statistically significant similarity between nodes. In this paper, we introduce a new method for backbone extraction that does not rely on any particular null model, but instead uses the empirical distribution of similarity weight to determine and then retain statistically significant edges. We show that our method adapts to the heterogeneity of local edge weight distributions in several paradigmatic real world networks, and in doing so retains their multiscale structure with relatively insignificant additional computational costs. We anticipate that this simple approach will be of great use in the analysis of massive, highly connected weighted networks.},

abstract = {We determine precipitation regions for the United States-Mexico border region based on seasonality and variability of monthly precipitation at 309 stations for the period 1961 to 1990. Using a correlation matrix of input data to avoid the effect of elevation on precipitation, we apply principal com- ponents analysis with oblique rotation to regionalize this large, climatologically complex study area. We examine the applicability of the method, 2 techniques for defining region boundaries, the various defined regions themselves, and the effects of transforming input data and changing obliquity of com- ponent rotation. We obtain 9 consistent and largely contiguous regions from each of the analyses, including regions for the North American monsoon, the low deserts, the California Mediterranean regime, and for summer precipitation regimes adjoining the Gulf of Mexico. The derived regions and associated boundaries make physical sense in terms of the driving atmospheric processes, and they are robust to transformed input data and changes in rotation procedures. The central border regions are remarkably consistent across analyses, with small changes to peripheral regions. We also identify 4 monsoon sub-regions, and we illustrate the applicability of the regionalization via an analysis of rela- tionships between monsoon precipitation variability and 500 mb pressure heights. Significantly differ- ent 500 mb circulation patterns are associated with wet and dry monsoon seasons in each of the sub- regions, and it appears that shifts in 500 mb circulation relative to the geographic position of each sub-region influence seasonal precipitation variability, directly or indirectly. There are important dif- ferences between some sub-regions, but in general wet monsoons are associated with northward meridional bulging of the subtropical anticyclone over the continental monsoon areas, while dry mon- soons are associated with zonal stretching of the subtropical anticyclone over adjacent oceans with slightly higher pressure-heights. Overall, the study provides a clear regionalization of the precipitation climatology for the southwest United States and northern Mexico, and shows its utility for studies of cli- mate variability.},

abstract = {AbstractThe climate of the past millennium provides a baseline for understanding the background of natural climate variability upon which current anthropogenic changes are superimposed. As this period also contains high data density from proxy sources (e.g. ice cores, stalagmites, corals, tree rings, and sediments), it provides a unique opportunity for understanding both global and regional-scale climate responses to natural forcing. Towards that end, an ensemble of simulations with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) for the period 850-2005 (the CESM Last Millennium Ensemble, or CESM-LME) is now available to the community. This ensemble includes simulations forced with the transient evolution of solar intensity, volcanic emissions, greenhouse gases, aerosols, land use conditions, and orbital parameters, both together and individually. The CESM-LME thus allows for evaluation of the relative contributions of external forcing and internal variability to changes evident in the paleoclimate data record, as well as providing a longer-term perspective for understanding events in the modern instrumental period. It also constitutes a dynamically consistent framework within which to diagnose mechanisms of regional variability. Results demonstrate an important influence of internal variability on regional responses of the climate system during the past millennium. All the forcings, particularly large volcanic eruptions, are found to be regionally influential during the preindustrial period, while anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol changes dominate the forced variability of the mid to late 20th century.},

abstract = {The development of a 2 degrees lat x 3 degrees long grid of summer drought reconstructions for the continental United States estimated from a dense network of annual tree-ring chronologies is described. The drought metric used is the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). The number of grid points is 154 and the reconstructions cover the common period 1700-1978. In producing this grid, an automated gridpoint regression method called "point-by-point regression" was developed and tested. In so doing, a near-optimal global solution was found for its implementation. The reconstructions have been thoroughly tested for validity using PDSI data not used in regression modeling. In general, most of the gridpoint estimates of drought pass the verification tests used. In addition, the spatial features of drought in the United States have been faithfully recorded in the reconstructions even though the method of reconstruction is not explicitly spatial in its design. The drought reconstructions show that the 1930s "Dust Bowl" drought was the most severe such event to strike the United States since 1700. Other more local droughts are also revealed in the regional patterns of drought obtained by rotated principal component analysis. These reconstructions are located on a NOAA Web site at the World Data Center-A in Boulder, Colorado, and can be freely downloaded from there.},

abstract = {The persistence of small populations is influenced by genetic structure and functional connectivity. We used two network-based approaches to understand the persistence of the northern Idaho ground squirrel (Urocitellus brunneus) and the southern Idaho ground squirrel (U. endemicus), two congeners of conservation concern. These graph theoretic approaches are conventionally applied to social or transportation networks, but here are used to study population persistence and connectivity. Population graph analyses revealed that local extinction rapidly reduced connectivity for the southern species, while connectivity for the northern species could be maintained following local extinction. Results from gravity models complemented those of population graph analyses, and indicated that potential vegetation productivity and topography drove connectivity in the northern species. For the southern species, development (roads) and small-scale topography reduced connectivity, while greater potential vegetation productivity increased connectivity. Taken together, the results of the two network-based methods (population graph analyses and gravity models) suggest the need for increased conservation action for the southern species, and that management efforts have been effective at maintaining habitat quality throughout the current range of the northern species. To prevent further declines, we encourage the continuation of management efforts for the northern species, whereas conservation of the southern species requires active management and additional measures to curtail habitat fragmentation. Our combination of population graph analyses and gravity models can inform conservation strategies of other species exhibiting patchy distributions.},

abstract = {Cooperation among relatives is often regarded as evidence of kin selection. Yet altruism not requiring shared genes can also evolve among relatives. If characteristics of relatives (such as proximity, familiarity, or trust) make kin preferred social partners, the primary causes of nepotistic biases may reside principally in direct fitness payoffs from cooperation rather than indirect fitness payoffs acquired from aiding collateral kin. We consider the roles of kin selection and reciprocal altruism in maintaining nepotistic food transfers on an Ache reservation in northeastern Paraguay. Households do not primarily direct aid to related households that receive larger comparative marginal gains from food intake as we would predict under kin selection theory. Instead, (1) food transfers favor households characterized by lower relative net energy production values irrespective of kinship ties, (2) households display significant positive correlations in amounts exchanged with each other, suggesting contingency in food transfers, and (3) kinship interacts with these positive correlations in amounts households exchange with each other, indicating even stronger contingency in sharing among related households than among unrelated households. While kin are preferred recipients of food aid, food distributions favor kin that have given more to the distributing household in the past rather than kin that would benefit more from the aid. Such discrimination among kin accords better with reciprocal altruism theory than with kin selection theory.},

abstract = {Major climatic impacts from ENSO and the North American Monsoon in the U.S. Southwest provide fortuitous circumstances for exploring the suitability of stable-carbon isotope ({\OE}¥13 C) composition of tree rings to represent and reconstruct interannual climate variability. We sampled ponderosa pine tree rings at eight sites in seven mountain ranges over a 500-km transect in southern Arizona and New Mexico. We developed {\OE}¥13C chronologies for 1985-1995 by subdividing rings into pre- and post-monsoon-onset segments based on the presence of a false-latewood band in each ring induced by the arid period immediately preceding the summer monsoon, pooling these segments from multiple trees at each site, and analyzing the cellulose component. Chronologies from two subsets of trees from the same site and separate chronologies from two different sites in the same mountain range indicate strong coherence and signal reproducibility. Additionally, the seasonal {\OE}¥13C patterns showed remarkable coherence across the transect, with the spatially disjunct easternmost chronology tending to be most frequently dissimilar. The {\OE}¥13 C values of ring subdivisions before the false-latewood band are generally positively correlated with winter Southern Oscillation Indices (SOI), resulting from the ENSO teleconnexion with southwestern winter/early spring precipitation. The 1313C from these sites correlates with monthly Palmer Drought Severity Indices (PDSI), with the strongest correlations occurring in progressively later months from first-formed to last-formed subdivisions. The post-false latewood subdivision 1313C was particularly strongly correlated with summer precipitation amount. These results confirm the strong influence of moisture on tree ring {\OE}¥13C and support their use in both temporal and spatial modes to infer past climate variability.

The short-lived occupation grew rapidly around A.D. 750, construction peaked in the A.D. 780s, but Ridges Basin was depopulated by A.D. 810. Chronostratigraphic, paleoenvironmental, and archaeological investigations indicate that abundant food resources related to intermittent marsh habitats attracted migrants into the basin and aided the growing population. Extreme droughts between A.D. 795 and 809 led to decreased crop yields and marsh desiccation. We attribute the abrupt depopulation of Ridges Basin to declining environmental conditions and societal stresses. We describe the impact of marsh formation on the inhabitants, and explore the wider implications of marshes and reservoirs on the Puebloan landscape. We suggest that early Puebloans positioned their settlements in proximity to natural marshes to take advantage of the abundant plant and animal resources, which later Puebloans achieved through the construction of reservoirs.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons LtdAcross the globe, wild bees are threatened by ongoing natural habitat loss, risking the maintenance of plant biodiversity and agricultural production. Despite the ecological and economic importance of wild bees and the fact that several species are now managed for pollination services worldwide, little is known about how land use and beekeeping practices jointly influence gene flow. Using stingless bees as a model system, containing wild and managed species that are presumed to be particularly susceptible to habitat degradation, here we examine the main drivers of tropical bee gene flow. We employ a novel landscape genetic approach to analyse data from 135 populations of 17 stingless bee species distributed across diverse tropical biomes within the Americas. Our work has important methodological implications, as we illustrate how a maximum-likelihood approach can be applied in a meta-analysis framework to account for multiple factors, and weight estimates by sample size. In contrast to previously held beliefs, gene flow was not related to body size or deforestation, and isolation by geographic distance (IBD) was significantly affected by management, with managed species exhibiting a weaker IBD than wild ones. Our study thus reveals the critical importance of beekeeping practices in shaping the patterns of genetic differentiation across bee species. Additionally, our results show that many stingless bee species maintain high gene flow across heterogeneous landscapes. We suggest that future efforts to preserve wild tropical bees should focus on regulating beekeeping practices to maintain natural gene flow and enhancing pollinator-friendly habitats, prioritizing species showing a limited dispersal ability.},

abstract = {Interannual variability of the summer monsoon in the southwestern United States is controlled by various ocean- and land-based conditions (e.g., SST, soil moisture, and snow cover) that provide sources of memory of antecedent climate anomalies such as ENSO. It is hypothesized that this interannual variability is also modulated by decade-scale fluctuations in the North Pacific SSTs. The following observations have been made in support of this hypothesis. First, the summer precipitation regime is dominated by a continental-scale precipitation pattern characterized by an out-of-phase relationship between precipitation in the southwestern United States and that in the Great Plains of the United States. Second, interannual fluctuations in the onset date of the monsoon in the southwestern United States are significantly correlated with interannual fluctuations in the intensity of summer rainfall in this region such that early monsoons are often very wet and late monsoons tend to be dry. Third, wet (dry) monsoons in the southwestern United States often follow winters characterized by dry (wet) conditions in the southwestern United States and wet (dry) conditions in the northwestern United States. Finally, interannual variability of the summer monsoon in the southwestern United States is modulated by long-term (decade scale) fluctuations in the North Pacific SSTs. The mechanism relating the North Pacific SST pattern to interannual variability in the summer monsoon appears to be via the impact of variations in the Pacific jet on West Coast precipitation regimes during the preceding winter. Multiyear fluctuations in the North Pacific SST pattern are consistent with multiyear fluctuations in the atmospheric circulation and in the West Coast precipitation regimes during Northern Hemisphere (NH) winter, hence with multiyear variability in the summer monsoon state. Influences on the summer monsoon during the preceding winter and spring are tied together using appropriate SST indices that capture decade-scale variability in the North Pacific during NH winter and interannual variability in the eastern tropical Pacific during NH spring. The results suggest that decadal variability in the North Pacific SSTs may be an important factor in determining long-term periods of summertime drought or rainy conditions both in the southwestern United States and in the Great Plains of the United States.},

abstract = {Most organisms disperse at some life-history stage, but different research traditions to study dispersal have evolved in botany, zoology, and epidemiology. In this paper, we synthesize concepts, principles, patterns, and processes in dispersal across organisms. We suggest a consistent conceptual framework for dispersal, which utilizes generalized gravity models. This framework will facilitate communication among research traditions, guide the development of dispersal models for theoretical and applied ecology, and enable common representation across taxonomic groups, encapsulating processes at the source and destination of movement, as well as during the intervening relocation process, while allowing each of these stages in the dispersal process to be addressed separately and in relevant detail. For different research traditions, certain parts of the dispersal process are less studied than others (e.g., seed release processes in plants and termination of dispersal in terrestrial and aquatic animals). The generalized gravity model can serve as a unifying framework for such processes, because it captures the general conceptual and formal components of any dispersal process, no matter what the relevant biological timescale involved. We illustrate the use of the framework with examples of passive (a plant), active (an animal), and vectored (a fungus) dispersal, and point out promising applications, including studies of dispersal mechanisms, total dispersal kernels, and spatial population dynamics.},

abstract = {The late pre-Hispanic period in the US Southwest (A.D. 1200-1450) was characterized by large-scale demographic changes, including long-distance migration and population aggregation. To reconstruct how these processes reshaped social networks, we compiled a comprehensive artifact database from major sites dating to this interval in the western Southwest. We combine social network analysis with geographic information systems approaches to reconstruct network dynamics over 250 y. We show how social networks were transformed across the region at previously undocumented spatial, temporal, and social scales. Using well-dated decorated ceramics, we track changes in network topology at 50-y intervals to show a dramatic shift in network density and settlement centrality from the northern to the southern Southwest after A.D. 1300. Both obsidian sourcing and ceramic data demonstrate that long-distance network relationships also shifted from north to south after migration. Surprisingly, social distance does not always correlate with spatial distance because of the presence of network relationships spanning long geographic distances. Our research shows how a large network in the southern Southwest grew and then collapsed, whereas networks became more fragmented in the northern Southwest but persisted. The study also illustrates how formal social network analysis may be applied to large-scale databases of material culture to illustrate multigenerational changes in network structure.},

A similar argument can be applied to the ecological models of Lotka and Volterra. Furthermore, it is shown that the two methodologies can be applied in combination to generate the Boltzmann, Lotka and Volterra (BLV) models. These techniques enable both spatial interaction and spatial structural evolution to be modelled, and it is argued that they potentially provide a much richer modelling methodology than that currently used in the analysis of 'scale-free' networks.},

abstract = {The relationship between the three primary modes of Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) variability-the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific decadal oscillation, and the North Pacific mode-and U.S. warm season hydroclimate is examined. In addition to precipitation, drought and stream flow data are analyzed to provide a comprehensive picture of the lower-frequency components of hydrologic variability. ENSO and the two decadal modes are extracted from a single unfiltered analysis, allowing a direct intercomparison of the modal structures and continental linkages. Both decadal modes have signals in the North Pacific, but the North Pacific mode captures most of the local variability. A summertime U.S. hydroclimatic signal is associated with all three SST modes, with the linkages of the two decadal modes comparable in strength to that of ENSO. The three SST variability modes also appear to play a significant role in long-term U.S. drought events. In particular, the northeastern drought of the 1960s is shown to be closely linked to the North Pacific mode. Concurrent with the drought were large positive SST anomalies in the North Pacific, quite similar in structure to the North Pacific mode, and an example of a physical realization of the mode. Correspondingly, the 1962-66 drought pattern had considerable similarity to the drought regression associated with the North Pacific mode. Analysis of upper-level stationary wave activity during the drought period shows a flux emanating from the North Pacific and propagating over the United States. The near-equivalent-barotropic circulation anomalies originating in the North Pacific culminate in a cyclonic circulation over the East Coast that, at low levels, opposes the climatological inflow of moisture in an arc over the continent from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast, consistent with the observed drought.},

We present a novel application of network analysis to domestic food flows within the USA, a country with global importance as a major agricultural producer and trade power. We find normal node degree distributions and Weibull node strength and betweenness centrality distributions. An unassortative network structure with high clustering coefficients exists. These network properties indicate that the USA food flow network is highly social and well-mixed. However, a power law relationship between node betweenness centrality and node degree indicates potential network vulnerability to the disturbance of key nodes. We perform an equality analysis which serves as a benchmark for global food trade, where the Gini coefficient = 0.579, Lorenz asymmetry coefficient = 0.966, and Hoover index = 0.442. These findings shed insight into trade network scaling and proxy free trade and equitable network architectures.},

abstract = {Explaining functional connectivity among occupied habitats is crucial for understanding metapopulation dynamics and species ecology. Landscape genetics has primarily focused on elucidating how ecological features between observations influence gene flow. Functional connectivity, however, may be the result of both these between-site (landscape resistance) landscape characteristics and at-site (patch quality) landscape processes that can be captured using network based models. We test hypotheses of functional connectivity that include both between-site and at-site landscape processes in metapopulations of Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) by employing a novel justification of gravity models for landscape genetics (eight microsatellite loci, 37 sites, n = 441). Primarily used in transportation and economic geography, gravity models are a unique approach as flow (e.g. gene flow) is explained as a function of three basic components: distance between sites, production/attraction (e.g. at-site landscape process) and resistance (e.g. between-site landscape process). The study system contains a network of nutrient poor high mountain lakes where we hypothesized a short growing season and complex topography between sites limit R. luteiventris gene flow. In addition, we hypothesized production of offspring is limited by breeding site characteristics such as the introduction of predatory fish and inherent site productivity. We found that R. luteiventris connectivity was negatively correlated with distance between sites, presence of predatory fish (at-site) and topographic complexity (between-site). Conversely, site productivity (as measured by heat load index, at-site) and growing season (as measured by frost-free period between-sites) were positively correlated with gene flow. The negative effect of predation and positive effect of site productivity, in concert with bottleneck tests, support the presence of source-sink dynamics. In conclusion, gravity models provide a powerful new modelling approach for examining a wide range of both basic and applied questions in landscape genetics.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic migration barriers fragment many populations and limit the ability of species to respond to climate‐induced biome shifts. Conservation actions designed to conserve habitat connectivity and mitigate barriers are needed to unite fragmented populations into larger, more viable metapopulations, and to allow species to track their climate envelope over time. Landscape genetic analysis provides an empirical means to infer landscape factors influencing gene flow and thereby inform such conservation actions. However, there are currently many methods available for model selection in landscape genetics, and considerable uncertainty as to which provide the greatest accuracy in identifying the true landscape model influencing gene flow among competing alternative hypotheses. In this study, we used population genetic simulations to evaluate the performance of seven regression‐based model selection methods on a broad array of landscapes that varied by the number and type of variables contributing to resistance, the magnitude and cohesion of resistance, as well as the functional relationship between variables and resistance. We also assessed the effect of transformations designed to linearize the relationship between genetic and landscape distances. We found that linear mixed effects models had the highest accuracy in every way we evaluated model performance; however, other methods also performed well in many circumstances, particularly when landscape resistance was high and the correlation among competing hypotheses was limited. Our results provide guidance for which regression‐based model selection methods provide the most accurate inferences in landscape genetic analysis and thereby best inform connectivity conservation actions.},

abstract = {Research on the forcing of drought and pluvial events over North America is dominated by general cir- culation model experiments that often have operational limitations (e.g., computational expense, ability to simulate relevant processes, etc). We use a statistically based modeling approach to investigate sea surface temperature (SST) forcing of the twentieth century pluvial (1905–1917) and drought (1932–1939, 1948–1957, 1998–2002) events. A principal component (PC) analysis of Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) from the North American Drought Atlas separates the drought variability into five leading modes accounting for 62{\%} of the underlying variance. Over the full period spanning these events (1900–2005), the first three PCs significantly correlate with SSTs in the equatorial Pacific (PC 1), North Pacific (PC 2), and North Atlantic (PC 3), with spatial patterns (as defined by the empirical orthogonal functions) consistent with our understanding of North American drought responses to SST forcing. We use a large ensemble statistical modeling approach to determine how successfully we can reproduce these drought/pluvial events using these three modes of variability. Using Pacific forcing only (PCs 1–2), we are able to reproduce the 1948–1957 drought and 1905–1917 pluvial above a 95{\%} random noise threshold in over 90{\%} of the ensemble members; the addition of Atlantic forcing (PCs 1–2–3) provides only marginal improvement. For the 1998–2002 drought, Pacific forcing reproduces the drought above noise in over 65{\%} of the ensemble members, with the addition of Atlantic forcing increasing the number passing to over 80{\%}. The severity of the drought, however, is underestimated in the ensemble median, suggesting this drought intensity can only be achieved through internal variability or other processes. Pacific only forcing does a poor job of reproducing the 1932–1939 drought pattern in the ensemble median, and less than one third of ensemble members exceed the noise threshold (28{\%}). Inclusion of Atlantic forcing improves the ensemble median drought pattern and nearly doubles the number of ensemble members passing the noise threshold (52{\%}). Even with the inclusion of Atlantic forcing, the intensity of the simulated 1932–1939 drought is muted, and the drought itself extends too far into the southwest and southern Great Plains. To an even greater extent than the 1998–2002 drought, these results suggest much of the variance in the 1932–1939 drought is dependent on processes other than SST forcing. This study highlights the importance of internal noise and non SST processes for hydroclimatic variability over North America, complementing existing research using general circulation models.},

Less emphasis has been placed on the factors enabling differential persistence of villages, once formed; yet village life poses problems of social coordination. We find that data from a recently excavated Late Coalition period village on the Pajarito Plateau of New Mexico, Burnt Mesa Pueblo, exhibits less diversity in ceramic style than would be expected, if ceramic styles were "neutral," using as a baseline the ceramic diversity that typifies local hamlets of the Early Coalition period. The evidence suggests that the local transmission processes affecting ceramic design were biased towards conformity (i.e., exhibit frequency-dependent bias). We take conformity in ceramic design to be one symptom of a developing social system that places great value on within-group cooperation, helping alleviate cooperative dilemmas in these early aggregates. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This paper presents the results of a regionalization study of the precipitation climate of the western United States using principal component analysis. Past eigen-based regionalization studies have relied on rain gauge networks, which is restrictive because rain gauge coverage is sparse, especially over complex terrain that exists in the western United States. Here, the use of alternate data products is examined by conducting a comparative regionalization using nine precipitation datasets used in hydrometeorological research. Five unique precipitation climates are identified within the western United States, which have centers and boundaries that are physically reasonable and that highlight the relationship between the precipitation climatology and local topography. Using the congruence coefficient as the measure of similarity between principal component solutions, the method is found to be generally stable across datasets. The exception is the National Centers for Environmental Prediction -Department of Energy (NCEP-DOE) Reanalysis 2, which frequently demonstrates only borderline agreement with the other datasets. The loading pattern differences among datasets are shown to be primarily a result of data differences in the representation of (i) precipitation over the Rocky Mountains, (ii) the eastward wet-to-dry precipitation gradient that occurs during the cold season, (iii) the magnitude and spatial extent of the North American monsoon signal, and (iv) precipitation in the desert southwest during spring and summer. Sensitivity tests were conducted to determine whether the spatial resolution and temporal domain of the input data would dramatically affect the solution, and these results show the methodology to be stable to differences in spatial/temporal data features. The results suggest that alternate data products can be used in regionalization studies, which has applications for rain gauge installation and planning, climate research, and numerical modeling experiments.},

One estimator may be preferred for certain types of data or research questions but more often the methods should be used in concert to establish robustness. In recent years, estimation has become just a first step before a deeper analysis of the implications of the results, notably in terms of welfare.

We propose that search in social networks can be made more e ective by incorporating weighted and directed inuence edges in the social graph, thus capturing both tie strength and asymmetry. Formally, the in uence a person A has over person B is de ned as the proportion of B's investments B makes on A. We study two large real-world networks, DBLP (a computer science bibliography network) and a network formed by one month of Twitter retweet data. Our experiments show that for these social networks, the best paths according to our in uence metric are not necessarily the shortest paths: a longer path is better in 68{\%} of searches in Twitter and 45{\%} of searches in DBLP. Furthermore, even when the best and shortest path lengths are equal, we nd that the best path is often better than a random shortest path of the same length by a signicant margin.},

The analysis suggests that a spatial effect cannot solely explain the emergence of organised network structure and it is necessary to include both spatial and endogenous network effects in the model.},

@article{Smaldino2013a,
abstract = {This paper concerns the confluence of two important areas of research in mathematical biology: spatial pattern formation and cooperative dilemmas. Mechanisms through which social organisms form spatial patterns are not fully understood. Prior work connecting cooperation and pattern formation has often included unrealistic assumptions that shed doubt on the applicability of those models toward understanding real biological patterns. I investigated a more biologically realistic model of cooperation among social actors. The environment is harsh, so that interactions with cooperators are strictly needed to survive. Harshness is implemented via a constant energy deduction. I show that this model can generate spatial patterns similar to those seen in many naturally-occuring systems. Moreover, for each payoff matrix there is an associated critical value of the energy deduction that separates two distinct dynamical processes. In low-harshness environments, the growth of cooperator clusters is impeded by defectors, but these clusters gradually expand to form dense dendritic patterns. In very harsh environments, cooperators expand rapidly but defectors can subsequently make inroads to form reticulated patterns. The resulting web-like patterns are reminiscent of transportation networks observed in slime mold colonies and other biological systems. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the age of Big Data, the widespread use of location-awareness technologies has made it possible to collect spatio-temporal interaction data for analyzing flow patterns in both physical space and cyberspace. This research attempts to explore and interpret patterns embedded in the network of phone-call interac- tion and the network of phone-users' movements, by considering the geographical context of mobile phone cells. We adopt an agglomerative clustering algorithm based on a Newman-Girvan modularity metric and propose an alternative modularity function incorporating a gravity model to discover the clus- tering structures of spatial-interaction communities using a mobile phone dataset from one week in a city in China. The results verify the distance decay effect and spatial continuity that control the process of par- titioning phone-call interaction, which indicates that people tend to communicate within a spatial- proximity community. Furthermore, we discover that a high correlation exists between phone-users' movements in physical space and phone-call interaction in cyberspace. Our approach presents a combined qualitative-quantitative framework to identify clusters and interaction patterns, and explains how geo- graphical context influences communities of callers and receivers. The findings of this empirical study are valuable for urban structure studies as well as for the detection of communities in spatial networks.},

abstract = {This paper begins with the hypothesis that Mikea, participants in a mixed foraging - fishing - farming - herding economy of southwestern Madagascar, may attempt to reduce interannual variance in food supply caused by unpredictable rainfall by following a simple rule- of- thumb: Practice an even mix of activities that covary positively with rainfall and activities that covary negatively with rainfall. Results from a historical matrix participatory exercise confirm that Mikea perceive that foraging and farming outcomes covary positively or negatively with rainfall. This paper further considers whether Mikea learn about covariation through personal observation and memory recall ( individual learning) or through socially transmitted ethnotheory ( social learning). Dual inheritance theory models by Boyd and Richerson ( 1988) predict that individual learning is more effective in spatially and temporally variable environments such as the Mikea Forest. In contrast, the psychological literature suggests that individuals judge covariation poorly when memory of past events is required, unless they share a socially learned theory that a covariation should exist ( Nisbett and Ross 1980). Results suggest that Mikea rely heavily on shared ethnotheory when judging covariation, but individuals continually strive to improve their judgment through individual observation.},

The multivariate ENSO index (MEI) is utilized to identify strong coherences associated with multiple months (1-, 2-, 4-, 6-, 12-, 24-, 48-month) of the Log-Standardized Hydrologic Drought Index (LSHDI) in the conterminous states for the period 1950–2005. Based on 56 years of monthly streamflow data for 102 forecast climate divisions, this research explores the spatial and temporal variation of hydrologic responses corresponding to ENSO events. Preliminary results show that a potential predictor of the dominant streamflow modes in the northern Great Plains is identified from streamflows in western Arizona. Also, positive relationships between hydrologic drought and El Ni{\~{n}}o were found in the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon, and northern California), whereas negative relationships were detected in southern California and the northern Great Plains. These findings will provide useful insights to help improve streamflow forecast potential and capabilities, and minimize the impacts of hydrologic events (e.g. floods and droughts) associated with ENSO events.},

The presented dataset is based on the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). The index was obtained using the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) TS3.0 dataset at a spatial resolution of 0.5. The advantages of the new dataset are that (i) it improves the spatial resolution of the unique global drought dataset at a global scale; (ii) it is spatially and temporally comparable to other datasets, given the probabilistic nature of the SPEI; and, in particular, (iii) it enables the identification of various drought types, given the multiscalar character of the SPEI.

These are more diversified regionally and sectorally in the case of the Sahel. The latter's non-cropping income is less covariant with the local cereal economy than is the case in the Sudanian sample.

Roads associated with Casa Negra, Casa Shields, and Goodman Point pueblos, located within Hovenweep National Monument in Southwest Colorado, offer the opportunity for this type of research. An initial hypothesis is that the associated road and trail network was intended to facilitate move- ment between these pueblos and neighboring habitation sites and symbolized group identity. To establish a functional interpretation of the roads, GIS analy- sis put the roads and trials in the context of the greater landscape and their associated features. Spatial analysis was also supplemented with ground survey to observe the morphology of the roads and trails as well as to identify additional paths. To establish a symbolic function, habitation, and ritual sites that can be related to the road based upon a spatial analysis have been ana- lyzed along with a comparative study with Chaco Canyon. The conclusions that this research establishes provides context for future research concerning function and symbolism within the lived landscape.},

abstract = {An estimate of the net direction of climate interactions in different geographical regions is made by constructing a directed climate network from a regular latitude-longitude grid of nodes, using a directionality index (DI) based on conditional mutual information. Two datasets of surface air temperature anomalies - one monthly-averaged and another daily-averaged - are analyzed and compared. The network links are interpreted in terms of known atmospheric tropical and extratropical variability patterns. Specific and relevant geographical regions are selected, the net direction of propagation of the atmospheric patterns is analyzed and the direction of the inferred links is validated by recovering some well-known climate variability structures. These patterns are found to be acting at various time-scales, such as atmospheric waves in the extra-tropics or longer range events in the tropics. This analysis demonstrates the capability of the DI measure to infer the net direction of climate interactions and may contribute to improve the present understanding of climate phenomena and climate predictability. The work presented here also stands out as an application of advanced tools to the analysis of empirical, real-world data.},

Our inference is based on a single equation that includes variables to capture the effect of spatial structure. Special attention is given to a proper estimation method: we estimate the distance-decay parameters by nonlinear weighted least-squares with balancing factors. It appears that neither an exponential nor a power distance-decay function fits the data well. Using a spline regression we find a cost elasticity of -4 for distances around 20 km and a much smaller value for shorter and longer distances. It appears that the logarithm of distance decay can be described adequately as a (downward) logistic function of log cost.},

abstract = {One of the most prominent but least understood demographic phenomena in the precontact Southwest is the disappearance of the Hohokam from the valleys of southern Arizona. Despite extensive research, no widely accepted explanation has been offered. We argue that the failure to identify a satisfactory cause is due to excessive focus on catastrophic phenomena and terminal occupations, and a lack of attention to gradual demographic processes. Based on a combination of macro-regional population studies and local research in the lower San Pedro River valley, we present an explanation for gradual popula- tion decline precipitated by social and economic coalescence beginning in the late A.D. 1200s. In the southern Southwest an influx of immigrants from the north led to a shift from a dispersed, extensive settlement/subsistence strategy to increased conflict, aggregation, and economic intensification. This shift resulted in diminished health and transformation from pop- ulation growth to decline. Over approximately 150 years gradual population decline resulted in small remnant groups unable to maintain viable communities. Small, terminal populations were ultimately unable to continue identifiable Hohokam cul- tural traditions and consequently disappeared from the archaeological record of southern Arizona, either through migra- tion or a shift in lifestyle that rendered them archaeologically invisible},

abstract = {What relationships can be understood between resilience and vulnerability in socialecological systems? In particular, what vulnerabilities are exacerbated or ameliorated by different sets of social practices associated with water management? These questions have been examined primarily through the study of contemporary or recent historic cases. Archaeology extends scientific observation beyond all social memory and can thus illuminate interactions occurring over centuries or millennia. We examined trade-offs of resilience and vulnerability in the changing social, technological, and environmental contexts of three long-term, pre-Hispanic sequences in the U.S. Southwest: the Mimbres area in southwestern New Mexico (AD 650–1450), the Zuni area in northern New Mexico (AD 850–1540), and the Hohokam area in central Arizona (AD 700–1450). In all three arid landscapes, people relied on agricultural systems that depended on physical and social infrastructure that diverted adequate water to agricultural soils. However, investments in infrastructure varied across the cases, as did local environmental conditions. Zuni farming employed a variety of small-scale water control strategies, including centuries of reliance on small runoff agricultural systems; Mimbres fields were primarily watered by small-scale canals feeding floodplain fields; and the Hohokam area had the largest canal system in pre-Hispanic North America. The cases also vary in their historical trajectories: at Zuni, population and resource use remained comparatively stable over centuries, extending into the historic period; in the Mimbres and Hohokam areas, there were major demographic and environmental transformations. Comparisons across these cases thus allow an understanding of factors that promote vulnerability and influence resilience in specific contexts.},

abstract = {We use an agent-based model to analyze the effects of spatial heterogeneity and agents' mobility on social-ecological outcomes. Our model is a stylized representation of a dynamic population of agents moving and harvesting a renewable resource. Cooperators (agents who harvest an amount close to the maximum sustainable yield) and selfish agents (those who harvest an amount greater than the sustainable yield) are simulated in the model. Three indicators of the outcomes of the system are analyzed: the number of settlements, the resource level, and the proportion of cooperators in the population. Our paper adds a more realistic approach to previous studies on the evolution of cooperation by considering a social-ecological system in which agents move in a landscape to harvest a renewable resource. Our results conclude that resource dynamics play an important role when studying levels of cooperation and resource use. Our simulations show that the agents' mobility significantly affects the outcomes of the system. This response is nonlinear and very sensible to the type of spatial distribution of the resource richness. In our simulations, better outcomes of long-term sustainability of the resource are obtained with moderate agent mobility and cooperation is enhanced in harsh environments with low resource level in which cooperative groups have natural boundaries fostered by agents' low mobility.},

These effects operate through local weather parameters such as temperature, wind, rain, snow, and ocean currents, as well as interactions among these. In the temperate zone, local variations in weather are often coupled over large geographic areas through the transient behavior of atmospheric planetary-scale waves. These variations drive temporally and spatially averaged exchanges of heat, momentum, and water vapor that ultimately determine growth, recruitment, and migration patterns. Recently, there have been several studies of the impact of large-scale climatic forcing on ecological systems.

abstract = {Using results taken from a finescale (25 km), regional modeling  simulation for the summer of 1999, along with contemporaneous daily  surface observations, synoptic variations in summertime precipitation  over the southwestern United States are described and analyzed. Two  separate techniques for characterizing and evaluating large-scale  summertime precipitation patterns within the observed and simulated  systems are presented; in addition, these evaluation/characterization  techniques are used to analyze the hydrologic forcings associated with  observed and simulated modes of rainfall variability. Overall, two  robust spatiotemporal precipitation patterns are identified involving 1)  precipitation over the western portion of the Rocky Mountain plateau  centered on eastern Arizona and southern Utah, and 2) precipitation  located over the eastern portion of the plateau and the elevated  orography of eastern New Mexico and southern Colorado. Time series  associated with these two precipitation regimes are correlated with  low-level and midlevel circulation patterns in order to investigate the  related large-scale environmental conditions. It is found that for both  regimes intraseasonal precipitation is related to the intrusion of  midtroposphere, midlatitude low-pressure anomalies over the southwestern  United States, resulting in synoptic-scale shifts in the position of  the climatological midtroposphere monsoon ridge. The interaction between  the resultant midtroposphere pressure fields and the quasi-stationary  monsoon surface pressures found over the Rocky Mountain plateau during  the summertime produce large-scale vertical velocities consistent with  the observed and simulated rainfall patterns associated with each  regime.},

abstract = {Human societies have adapted to spatial and temporal variability, such as that found in the prehistoric American Southwest. A question remains as to what the implications are of different social adaptations to long-term vulnerability of small-scale human societies. A stylized agent-based model is presented that captures small-group decision making on movements and resource use in ancient arid environments. The impact of various assumptions concerning storage, exchange, sharing, and migration on indicators of aggregation and sustainability are explored. Climate variability is found to increase the resilience of population levels at the system level. Variability reduces the time a population stays in one location and can degrade the soils. In addition to climate variability, the long-term population dynamics is mainly driven by the level of storage and the decision rules governing when to migrate and with whom to exchange.},

A considerable body of recent work from the global environmental change research community attempts to under- stand whether and how societies will be able to continue to cope in the face of global change. Will they be able to respond to the shear pace at which social and natural systems are currently changing? If faced with one of either natural or social change, perhaps they can. However, in the face of ‘‘double exposure'', the simultaneous impacts of global environmental change and globalization (O'Brien and Leichenko, 2000) that households, villages, and regions will face, they may be stretched beyond their capacity to cope on their own. Again, dealing with double exposure on its own may be possible through the concerted effort of governing bodies at multiple levels, but the pace of change may limit the effectiveness of the response. There is the additional issue that the context in which they operate is structurally changing. Both globalization and global environmental change are generating a highly connected global-scale system in which decisions at small scales are influenced by and will influence processes at the global scale in unpredictable and novel ways (Adger et al., 2009).

abstract = {Dispersal can impact population dynamics and geographic variation, and thus, genetic approaches that can establish which landscape factors influence population connectivity have ecological and evolutionary importance. Mixed models that account for the error structure of pairwise datasets are increasingly used to compare models relating genetic differentiation to pairwise measures of landscape resistance. A model selection framework based on information criteria metrics or explained variance may help disentangle the ecological and landscape factors influencing genetic structure, yet there are currently no consensus for the best protocols. Here, we develop landscape-directed simulations and test a series of replicates that emulate independent empirical datasets of two species with different life history characteristics (greater sage-grouse; eastern foxsnake). We determined that in our simulated scenarios, AIC and BIC were the best model selection indices and that marginal R2 values were biased toward more complex models. The model coefficients for landscape variables generally reflected the underlying dispersal model with confidence intervals that did not overlap with zero across the entire model set. When we controlled for geographic distance, variables not in the underlying dispersal models (i.e., nontrue) typically overlapped zero. Our study helps establish methods for using linear mixed models to identify the features underlying patterns of dispersal across a variety of landscapes.},

abstract = {Freshwater aquatic systems in North America are being invaded by many different species, ranging from fish, mollusks, cladocerans to various bacteria and viruses. These invasions have serious ecological and economic impacts. Human activities such as recreational boating are an important pathway for dispersal. Gravity models are used to quantify the dispersal effect of human activity. Gravity models currently used in ecology are deterministic. This paper proposes the use of stochastic gravity models in ecology, which provides new capabilities both in model building and in potential model applications. These models allow us to use standard statistical inference tools such as maximum likelihood estimation and model selection based on information criteria. To facilitate prediction, we use only those covariates that are easily available from common data sources and can be forecasted in future. This is important for forecasting the spread of invasive species in geographical and temporal domain. The proposed model is portable, that is it can be used for estimating relative boater traffic and hence relative propagule pressure for the lakes not covered by current boater surveys. This makes our results broadly applicable to various invasion prediction and management models. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

To reduce their vulnerability to a shortfall in their food supply, small-scale farmers developed short-term strategies, including storage and community-scale sharing, to mitigate inter-annual variation in crop production and lorg.term strategies, such as migration, to mitigate the effects of sustained droughts. We use the archaeological and paleoclimatic records from A.D. 900-1600 in two regions of the American Southwest to explore the nature of variation in the availability of water for crops, and the strategies that enhanced the resilience of prehistoric agricultural production to climatic variation. Drawing on information concerning contemporary small.scale farming in semi-arid environments, we then suggest that the risk coping and mitigation strategies that have endured for millennia are relevant to enhancing the resilience of contemporary farmers' livelihoods to environmental and economic pertubations.},

Observations and models indicate robust tropical Pacific and tropical North Atlantic forcing of annual mean precipitation and soil moisture with the most heavily influenced areas being in southwestern North America and the southern Great Plains. In these regions, individual wet and dry years, droughts, and decadal variations are well reproduced in atmosphere models forced by observed SSTs.

abstract = {The overall amount of precipitation deposited along the West Coast and western cordillera of North America from 25 8 to 55 8 N varies from year to year, and superimposed on this domain-average variability are varying north–south contrasts on timescales from at least interannual to interdecadal. In order to better understand the north–south precipitation contrasts, their interannual and decadal variations are studied in terms of how much they affect overall precipitation amounts and how they are related to large-scale climatic patterns. Spatial empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) and spatial moments (domain average, central latitude, and latitudinal spread) of zonally averaged precipitation anomalies along the westernmost parts of North America are analyzed, and each is correlated with global sea level pressure (SLP) and sea surface temperature series, on interannual (defined here as 3–7 yr) and decadal ( . 7 yr) timescales. The interannual band considered here corresponds to timescales that are particularly strong in tropical climate variations and thus is expected to contain much precipitation variability that is related to El Nin ̃o–Southern Oscillation; the decadal scale is defined so as to capture the whole range of long-term climatic variations affecting western North America. Zonal EOFs of the interannual and decadal filtered versions of the zonal-precipitation series are remarkably similar. At both timescales, two leading EOFs describe 1) a north–south seesaw of precipitation pivoting near 40 8 N and 2) variations in precipitation near 40 8 N, respectively. The amount of overall precipitation variability is only about 10{\%} of the mean and is largely determined by precipitation variations around 40 8 –45 8 N and most consistently influenced by nearby circulation patterns; in this sense, domain-average precipitation is closely related to the second EOF. The central latitude and latitudinal spread of precipitation distributions are strongly influenced by precipitation variations in the southern parts of western North America and are closely related to the first EOF. Central latitude of precipitation moves south (north) with tropical warming (cooling) in association with midlatitude western Pacific SLP variations, on both interannual and decadal timescales. Regional patterns and zonal averages of precipitation-sensitive tree-ring series are used to corroborate these patterns and to extend them into the past and appear to share much long- and short-term information with the instrumentally based zonal precipitation EOFs and moments.},

The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups.

Potential nonlinearities and nonstationarities in the relationships are noted. During the first three decades of this century, summer drought teleconnections in response to SST patterns linked to ENSO are found to be strongest in the southern regions of Texas, with extensions into regions of the Midwest. From the 1930s through the 1950s, the drought teleconnection pattern is found to extend into southern Arizona. The most recent three decades show weak teleconnections between summer drought over southern Texas and Arizona, and winter SSTs, which is consistent with previous findings. Instead, the response to Pacific SSTs shows a clear shift to the western United States and southern regions of California. These epochal variations are consistent with epochal variations observed in ENSO and other low-frequency climate indicators. This changing teleconnection response complicates statistical forecasting of drought.},

However, attribution of suboptimal behavior to risk minimization without consideration of the structure of risk and its environmental context obscures the complexity of agricultural decision-making. The productive potential of a prehistoric agricultural system that includes floodwater and dry farming and stream irrigation is modeled using Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis to evaluate whether diversification occurred as a response to population pressure or as a risk buffering strategy. The estimated productive potential of floodwater and irrigation farming is sufficient to have supported the estimated local population, suggesting that risk buffering is a more likely explanation. Floodwater farming and stream irrigation form a dual strategy that is effective at reducing risk. However, the potential of dry farming for subsistence production is insufficient for buffering more than a 2{\%} productive shortfall. We propose that, within this generally risk-averse economy, dry farming was oriented toward the production of nonsubsistence crops such as cotton. $\backslash$nKEY WORDS: risk; diversification; geographic information system; Southwestern prehistory; population pressure.},

abstract = {Judging by the variety of explanations proffered in the literature, societies apparently collapse for a variety of reasons. In an influential review, Tainter (1988:39–90) reports that published explanations for the famous collapses of the Classic Maya, the western Roman Empire, and many other less famous episodes such as the demise of the Chimu of Peru or the Chacoan system in the U.S. Southwest tend to fall into 11 major categories, with resource depletion or deterioration being one of the most commonly adduced causes (see, for example, Hodell, Curtis, and Brenner 1995, Weiss and Bradley 2001). Another common explanation is insufficient response to circumstances, or “failure to adapt.” Tainter (1988:50, emphasis added) rejects both such explanations. Resource-degradation explanations raise the question  why societies sit by and watch the encroaching weakness without taking corrective actions. . . . As it becomes apparent to the members or administrators of a complex society that a resource base is deteriorating, it seems most reasonable to assume that some rational steps are taken towards a resolution. . . . If a society cannot deal with resource depletion (which all societies are to some extent designed to do) then the truly interesting questions revolve around the society, not the resource. What structural, political, or economic factors in a society prevented an appropriate response?  As to the possibility that societies fail because they are inherently fragile or static or incapable of shifting directions, Tainter (1988:54–61, 89) considers this not so much an explanation as something that, if true in particular cases, must be explained.},

Notably at the percolation threshold the semantic space is characterised by scale-free behaviour at different levels of complexity and this relates the semantic space to a wide range of biological, social and linguistics phenomena. In particular we find that the cluster size distribution, representing the size of different semantic areas, is scale-free. Moreover the topology of the resulting semantic space is scale-free in the connectivity distribution and displays small-world properties. However its statistical properties do not allow a classical interpretation via a generative model based on a simple multiplicative process. After giving a detailed description and interpretation of the topological properties of the semantic space, we introduce a stochastic model of content-based network, based on a copy and mutation algorithm and on the Heaps' law, that is able to capture the main statistical properties of the analysed semantic space, including the Zipf's law for the word frequency distribution.},

Rain gauge data from a consistent 60-yr period show that mean rainfall increases linearly with elevation within a local area. A simple model (rain = normalized rainfall as a function of latitude and longitude + elevation coefficient × elevation) explains a large part of the spatial variability of mean rainfall. The rainfall model (the MSWR model) and digital elevation data were used to produce a 1° × 1° gridded rainfall climatology for July, August, and September. Regional rainfall estimated with this model is 9.3{\%} higher than an estimate based on arithmetic averaging of gauge data over 2° × 2° areas. For individual 2° × 2° cells, the difference between model rainfall and the arithmetic mean of gauge rainfall ranged from −250{\%} to +41{\%}. The MSWR model was used to remove orographic effects from regional rainfall fields. When rainfall is normalized to sea level, two rainfall maximums emerge: one in south-central Arizona associated with the Mexican monsoon maximum and one in southeastern New Mexico associated with the Gulf of Mexico. Detrended block kriging (using the MSWR model as an estimate of the long-term trend) and monthly rain gauge data were used to produce unbiased areal rainfall estimates that were compared to 1° × 1° satellite-based rainfall estimates. On a month-by-month basis, there were large differences between the two estimates, although the comparison improved after temporal averaging.},

abstract = {Migration is arguably one of the most important processes that link ecological and social systems across scales. Humans (and other organisms) tend to move in pursuit of better resources (both social and environmental). Such mobility may serve as a coping mechanism for short-term local-scale dilemmas and as a means of distributing organisms in relation to resources. Movement also may be viewed as a shift to a larger scale; that is, while it may solve short-term local problems, it may simultaneously have longer term and larger scale consequences. We conduct a quantitative analysis using dynamic modeling motivated by an archaeological case study to explore the dynamics that arise when population movement serves as a link between spatial scales. We use the model to characterize how ecological and social factors can lead to spatial variation in resource exploitation, and to investigate the circumstances under which migration may enhance or reduce the capacity of the system to absorb shocks at different scales.},

abstract = {Cultivation of agave was common in pre- Hispanic northern Mexico and the American Southwest, and scholars generally accept that it was a strategy to ensure food supply during years of drought when the maize crop failed. Some even suggest that incorporating agave culti- vation make large, nucleated settlements possible in arid northern Mexico ca. 500–900 CE. Yet the environmental circumstances under which farmers could reasonably expect such a strategy to decrease the chances of agricultural failure are not well understood. We explore the potential of this crop complementarity by assessing the risk of famine-induced migration events in different idealized environmental settings. We use Monte Carlo simulation to analyze a simple discrete-time, age-structured stochastic model for maize and agave agroecology, deriving the climatological conditions under which agave could have significantly reduced the probability of short- and long-term famine events. Investments in agave production made the most sense where average annual rainfall was between the levels that would ensure maximum maize yield and those that would mean loss of the maize crop due to drought- related mortality. Cultivating agave had little impact on famine risk at high (maize yields sufficient) and low (failure of both maize and agave) rainfall levels. Perhaps more surprisingly, it had its highest impact at moderate rainfall levels when variance in rainfall was relatively low. While a higher variance in rainfall increased the number of ‘good' years for maize—where production would exceed demand and allow for storage—it also increased the probability of simultaneous failures in both agave and maize production. These findings are difficult to apply to specific times and places in the past, because rainfall distribution in complex, environments change, and it is difficult to take all relevant human interventions into account. The analysis does, however, offer support for the proposition that agave cultivation could have significantly enhanced survival probabilities of large, nucleated settlements in certain circumstances. It remains for further study to identify such circumstances more precisely geographically and temporally.},

abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of spatially extended systems represents a challenge in diverse scientific disciplines, ranging from physics and mathematics to the earth and climate sciences or the neurosciences. This challenge has stimulated the development of sophisticated data analysis approaches adopting concepts from network theory: systems are considered to be composed of subsystems (nodes) which interact with each other (represented by edges). In many studies, such complex networks of interactions have been derived from empirical time series for various spatially extended systems and have been repeatedly reported to possess the same, possibly desirable, properties (e.g. small-world characteristics and assortativity). In this thesis we study whether and how interaction networks are influenced by the analysis methodology, i.e. by the way how empirical data is acquired (the spatial and temporal sampling of the dynamics) and how nodes and edges are derived from multivariate time series. Our modeling and numerical studies are complemented by field data analyses of brain activities that unfold on various spatial and temporal scales. We demonstrate that indications of small-world characteristics and assortativity can already be expected due solely to the analysis methodology, irrespective of the actual interaction structure of the system. We develop and discuss strategies to distinguish the properties of interaction networks related to the dynamics from those spuriously induced by the analysis methodology. We show how these strategies can help to avoid misinterpretations when investigating the dynamics of spatially extended systems.},

abstract = {Landscape genetics is a burgeoning field of interest that focuses on how site-specific factors influence the distribution of genetic variation and the genetic connectivity of individuals and populations. In this manuscript, we focus on two methodological extensions for landscape genetic analyses: the use of conditional genetic distance (cGD) derived from population networks and the utility of extracting potentially confounding effects caused by correlations between phylogeographic history and contemporary ecological factors. Individual-based simulations show that when describing the spatial distribution of genetic variation, cGD consistently outperforms the traditional genetic distance measure of linearized F(ST) under both 1- and 2-dimensional stepping stone models and Cavalli-Sforza and Edward's chord distance D(c) in 1-dimensional landscapes. To show how to identify and extract the effects of phylogeographic history prior to embarking on landscape genetic analyses, we use nuclear genotypic data from the Sonoran desert succulent Euphorbia lomelii (Euphrobiaceae), for which a detailed phylogeographic history has previously been determined. For E. lomelii, removing the effect of phylogeographic history significantly influences our ability to infer both the identity and the relative importance of spatial and bio-climatic variables in subsequent landscape genetic analyses. We close by discussing the utility of cGD in landscape genetic analyses.},

An additional 22{\%} of the variance in drought frequency is related to a complex spatial pattern of positive and negative trends in drought occurrence possibly related to increasing Northern Hemisphere temperatures or some other unidirectional climate trend. Recent droughts with broad impacts over the conterminous U.S. (1996, 1999-2002) were associated with North Atlantic warming (positive AMO) and northeastern and tropical Pacific cooling (negative PDO). Much of the long-term predictability of drought frequency may reside in the multidecadal behavior of the North Atlantic Ocean. Should the current positive AMO (warm North Atlantic) conditions persist into the upcoming decade, we suggest two possible drought scenarios that resemble the continental-scale patterns of the 1930s (positive PDO) and 1950s (negative PDO) drought.},

Three archaeological cases from the U.S. Southwest (Mimbres, Mesa Verde, and Hohokam) and new methods for assessing transformations and rigidity are used to evaluate this concept. They reveal the expected association between the severity of transformation and degree of rigidity, suggesting that a rigidity trap contributed to the Hohokam decline, which included significant human suffering.

abstract = {Nonlinear estimation of the gravity model with Poisson-type regression methods has become popular for modelling international trade flows, because it permits a better accounting for zero flows and extreme values in the distribution tail. Nevertheless, as trade flows are not independent from each other due to spatial and network autocorrelation, these methods may lead to biased parameter estimates. To overcome this problem, eigenvector spatial filtering (ESF) variants of the Poisson/negative binomial specifications have been proposed in the literature on gravity modelling of trade. However, no specific treatment has been developed for cases in which many zero flows are present. This paper contributes to the literature in two ways. First, by employing a stepwise selection criterion for spatial filters that is based on robust (sandwich) p-values and does not require likelihood-based indicators. In this respect, we develop an ad hoc backward stepwise function in R. Second, using this function, we select a reduced set of spatial filters that properly accounts for importer-side and exporter-side specific spatial effects, as well as network effects, both at the count and the logit processes of zero-inflated methods. Applying this estimation strategy to a cross-section of bilateral trade flows between a set of 64 countries for the year 2000, we find that our specification outperforms the benchmark models in terms of model fitting, both considering the AIC and in predicting zero (and small) flows.},

abstract = {Aim Our aim was to understand how similarity changes with distance in biological communities, to use the distance decay perspective as quantitative technique to describe biogeographic pattern, and to explore whether growth form, dispersal type, rarity, or support affected the rate of distance decay in similarity. Location North American spruce-fir forests, Appalachian montane spruce-fir forests. Methods We estimated rates of distance decay through regression of log-transformed compositional similarity against distance for pairwise comparisons of thirty-four white spruce plots and twenty-six black spruce plots distributed from eastern Canada to Alaska, six regional floras along the crest of the Appalachians, and six regional floras along the east–west extent of the boreal forest. Results Similarity decreased significantly with distance, with the most linear models relating the log of similarity to untransformed distance. The rate of similarity decay was 1.5–1.9 times higher for vascular plants than for bryophytes. The rate of distance decay was highest for berry-fruited and nut-bearing species (1.7 times higher than plumose-seeded species and 1.9 times higher than microseeded/spore species) and 2.1 times higher for herbs than woody plants. There was no distance decay for rare species, while species of intermediate frequency had 2.0 times higher distance decay rates than common species. The rate of distance decay was 2.7 times higher for floras from the fragmented Appalachians than for floras from the contiguous boreal forest. Main conclusions The distance decay of similarity can be caused by either a decrease in environmental similarity with distance (e.g. climatic gradients) or by limits to dispersal and niche width differences among taxa. Regardless of cause, the distance decay of similarity provides a simple descriptor of how biological diversity is distributed and therefore has consequences for conservation strategy.},

abstract = {Recent research has pointed to a number of inherent disadvantages of unrotated principal components and empirical orthogonal functions when these techniques are used to depict individual modes of variation of data matrices in exploratory analyses.  The various pitfalls are outlined and illustrated with an alternative method introduced to minimize these problems via available linear transformations known as simple structure rotations.  The rationale and theory behind simple structure rotation and Procrustes target rotation is examined in the context of meterological/climatological applications.  This includes a discussion of the six unique ways to decompose a rotated data set in order to maximize the physical interpretability of the rotated results.  The various analytic simple structure rotations available are compared by a Monte Carlo simulations, which is a modification of a similar technique developed by Tucker (1983), revealing that the DAPPFR and Promax k = 2 rotations are the most accurate in recovering the input structure of the modes of variations over a wide range of conditions.  Additionally, these results allow the investigator the opportunity to check the accuracy of the unrotated or rotated solution for specific types of data.   This is important because, in the past, the decision of whether or not to apply a specific rotation has been a 'blind decision'.   In response to this, a methodology is presented herein by which the researcher can assess the degree of simple structure embedded within any meteorological data set and then apply known information about the data to the Monte Carlo results to optimize the likelihood of achieving physically meaningful results from a principal component analysis.},

We consider two spatially distributed networks: a population migration ﬂow network within the US, and a network of mobile phone calls between cities in Belgium. For both networks we use the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix constructed from the link intensities to obtain informative visualizations and capture natural geographical subdivisions. We observe that some low-order eigenvectors localize very well and seem to reveal small geographically cohesive regions that match remarkably well with political and administrative boundaries. We discuss possible explanations for this observation by describing diffusion maps and localized eigenfunctions. In addition, we discuss a possible connection with the weighted graph cut problem, and provide numerical evidence supporting the idea that lower-order eigenvectors point out local cuts in the network. However, we do not provide a formal and rigorous justiﬁcation for our observations},

abstract = {The spatial and temporal distribution of point precipitation quantiles representing abnormal moisture conditions over the Colorado River Basin (CRB) is analyzed by means of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), calculated in annual and seasonal aggregations. From a cell-by-cell analysis, the area covered by abnormally wet and dry conditions during the last century shows an inverse relationship with their frequency of occurrence, with frequent events (occurring 80{\%} of the time) in which abnormal conditions cover less than 10{\%} of the basin and infrequent events (occurring 5{\%} of the time) in which abnormal conditions cover around 50{\%} of the basin. During El Ni{\~{n}}o years, both extremely wet and dry conditions are likely to occur, while only extremely dry conditions are probable during La Ni{\~{n}}a years. Regions of homogeneous SPI realizations were delimited using principal components analysis (PCA) to highlight major variation modes distinguishable in the basin, and a frequency analysis was performed over the reconstructed values of SPI to identify their multiannual oscillation modes. Common multiannual oscillations between the SPI index, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Bivariate El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (BEST) time series were explored using multichannel singular spectrum analysis (M-SSA). The coupled impact of PDO-ENSO indicates the presence of a trend and two significant oscillations around 5 and 15 years on the SPI time series. The occurrence of extreme SPI values associated with ENSO and PDO was also evaluated as a common product of these indices that highlights moisture conditions affected by common enhancement phases of ENSO and PDO. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Dynamical complex systems are then typically represented by a graph of temporal dependencies between time series of state variables of their subunits. It has been shown recently that graphs constructed in this way tend to have relatively clustered structure, potentially leading to spurious detection of small-world properties even in the case of systems with no or randomly distributed true interactions. However, the strength of this bias depends heavily on a range of parameters and its relevance for real-world data has not yet been established. In this work, we assess the relevance of the bias using two examples of multivariate time series recorded in natural complex systems.

abstract = {Two competing models concerning food transfers prominent in the anthropological literature conceptualize such transfers either as sharing or as exchange. Sharing is understood as situational transactions formed through demands and unconditional giving, whereas reciprocal exchange is understood in terms of networking and keeping score. I propose that the picture is more complicated than these classifications suggests. Drawing on data collected in Northwestern Namibia, I show that sharing and reciprocal exchange are dynamically interrelated in actual food transfers. As a local norm, people can demand food from anyone, and they are typically given food in response to a demand. However, in practice, food transfer networks emerge (N = 62) that are highly reciprocal and fit the exchange model much better. Although the sharing norm makes no restrictions on whom to ask, in practice people often turn to their neighbors. Interpersonal dynamics account for why some of those ties become strongly reciprocal and others do not. Under these circumstances, unconditional sharing, a norm that has been viewed as an alternative to exchange, can lead to reciprocity via reciprocity on demand.},

abstract = {Network models are widely used to represent relational information among interacting units and the structural implications of these relations. Recently, social network studies have focused a great deal of attention on random graph models of networks whose nodes represent individual social actors and whose edges represent a specified relationship between the actors. Most inference for social network models assumes that the presence or absence of all possible links is observed, that the information is completely reliable, and that there are no measurement (e.g., recording) errors. This is clearly not true in practice, as much network data is collected though sample surveys. In addition even if a census of a population is attempted, individuals and links between individuals are missed (i.e., do not appear in the recorded data). In this paper we develop the conceptual and computational theory for inference based on sampled network information. We first review forms of network sampling designs used in practice. We consider inference from the likelihood framework, and develop a typology of network data that reflects their treatment within this frame. We then develop inference for social network models based on information from adaptive network designs. We motivate and illustrate these ideas by analyzing the effect of link-tracing sampling designs on a collaboration network.},

Idiosyncratic shocks, however, are not limited to private goods but can also restrict an individual from partaking in or benefiting from a collective activity. In these situations, a group must decide whether to provide insurance to the affected member. We describe results of a laboratory experiment designed to test whether a simple sharing institution can sustain risk pooling in a social dilemma with idiosyncratic risk. We tested whether risk could be pooled without a commitment device and, separately, whether effective risk pooling induced greater cooperation in the social dilemma. We found that even in the absence of a commitment device or reputational considerations, subjects voluntarily pooled risk, thereby reducing variance in individual earnings. In spite of effective risk pooling, however, cooperation in the social dilemma was unaffected.},

The source of this spatial property of social networks, however, is yet unknown. The formation of social links is related to human dynamics both on the day-to-day, typically small scale, level of mobility, and on larger scale migration (or reallocation) movements. In this study we analyze human migration patterns by investigating the migration of 46.8 million individuals across the US during 19952000. We find that the probability of migration decreases as a power law of the distance, with exponent -1. We show that this finding offers an explanation for the gravitational law of social interaction. Possible explanations and implications of the scale-free migration pattern are discussed. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

By the end of that century, Ancestral Pueblo peoples no longer permanently inhabited the region. We present detailed recon- structions of precipitation based on tree rings from five geographic subregions of Ancestral Pueblo occupation (Mesa Verde, Tsegi/Kayenta, Chama, Cibola, and Santa Fe) and a consideration of distributions of archaeological ceramic styles and types from four corresponding Ancestral Pueblo subculture areas (Mesa Verde, Kayenta, Cibola, and the Northern Rio Grande) in order to explore Ancestral Pueblo strategies of adaptation to farming under conditions of often inadequate precipitation. Our analyses examine and corroborate the notion that Ancestral Pueblo peoples of the Mesa Verde region maintained long-term relationships of social interaction primarily with groups that were proximate and also experienced different and complementary patterns of precipitation. These social relationships, along with development of a marked gradient in precipitation, may have facili- tated eventual migration pathways from the Mesa Verde region to the northern Rio Grande.

abstract = {Need-based transfers are a widespread form of human cooperation across cultures that enhance survival in marginal environments. Examples include central place food sharing among foragers and stock friendships among pastoralists. Previous models have demonstrated that such systems lead to higher rates of herd survival under volatile ecological conditions, such as those experienced by the Maasai of East Africa. The Maasai use a need-based transfer system called osotua that leads to risk pooling. Here we implement osotua-style asking and giving rules on a network in order to understand which network features promote herd survival. We find that (1) greater network size increases herd survival when individuals selectively ask their wealthiest partner for livestock but not when they ask a partner at random, (2) greater network connectedness improves herd survival regardless of whether individuals ask their wealthiest partner or ask a partner at random, (3) greater network heterogeneity leads to higher herd survival with selective asking of wealthy partners and decreases herd survival for random asking. In general, selective asking of wealthy partners is associated with higher rates of herd survival. We also examined the features of survival networks in order to understand the characteristics of the networks that result from 50 simulated years of osotua-style sharing under ecologically volatile conditions and the elimination of individuals who do not stay above sustainability threshold. These results will help inform further fieldwork on the need-based transfer systems and increase our understanding of features of sharing networks that enable risk pooling. Simple decentralized sharing rules can be highly effective for pooling risk, suggesting that complex cultural institutions may not be necessary for expansion into ecologically marginal environments.},

The leading PCs are also used to estimate the fraction of the variance of summer precipitation that is explained by ENSO and by interannual variations of MJO activity. ENSO-related impacts on the NAMS are linked to meridional adjustments of the ITCZ. In its positive polarity, the leading PC of interannual variability is associated with warm (ENSO) episodes and is characterized by an expansion of the ITCZ toward the south, increased precipitation in a zonally oriented band just north of the equator, and decreased precipitation over Mexico and portions of the Caribbean. MJO-related impacts on the NAMS are linked to more regional meridional adjustments in the precipitation pattern over the eastern tropical Pacific. In its positive polarity, the leading PC of intraseasonal variability is associated with an intensification and northward adjustment of the precipitation pattern in the eastern tropical Pacific, with increased precipitation over the warm pool to the west of Mexico and over portions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. Both the interannual and intraseasonal modes have well-defined, but distinct, sea level pressure and surface wind signatures in the eastern tropical Pacific. These features extend to the middle troposphere and are capped by circulation features in the opposite sense in the upper troposphere. The relationship of the MJO to the NAMS is examined in more detail using the leading PC of intraseasonal variability and an objective procedure to identify the phase of MJO events. The leading PC is strongly related to the eastward progression of centers of enhanced (reduced) convection around the global Tropics on intra- seasonal timescales. Notably, a strong relationship between the leading mode of intraseasonal variability of the NAMS, the MJO, and the points of origin of tropical cyclones in the Pacific and Atlantic basins is also present.},

abstract = {This article considers critically how one of the oldest and most widely applied statistical methods, principal components analysis (PCA), is employed with spatial data. We first provide a brief guide to how PCA works: This includes robust and compositional PCA variants, links to factor analysis, latent variable modeling, and multilevel PCA. We then present two different approaches to using PCA with spatial data. First we look at the nonspatial approach, which avoids challenges posed by spatial data by using a standard PCA on attribute space only. Within this approach we identify four main methodologies, which we define as (1) PCA applied to spatial objects, (2) PCA applied to raster data, (3) atmospheric science PCA, and (4) PCA on flows. In the second approach, we look at PCA adapted for effects in geographical space by looking at PCA methods adapted for first-order nonstationary effects (spatial heterogeneity) and second-order stationary effects (spatial autocorrelation). We also describe how PCA can be used to investigate multiple scales of spatial autocorrelation. Furthermore, we attempt to disambiguate a terminology confusion by clarifying which methods are specifically termed ?spatial PCA? in the literature and how this term has different meanings in different areas. Finally, we look at a further three variations of PCA that have not been used in a spatial context but show considerable potential in this respect: simple PCA, sparse PCA, and multilinear PCA.},

abstract = {During the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), Western North America experienced episodes of intense aridity that persisted for multiple decades or longer. These megadroughts are well documented in many proxy records, but the causal mechanisms are poorly understood. General circulation models (GCMs) simulate megadroughts, but do not reproduce the temporal clustering of events during the MCA, suggesting they are not caused by the time history of volcanic or solar forcing. Instead, GCMs generate megadroughts through (1) internal atmospheric variability, (2) sea-surface temperatures, and (3) land surface and dust aerosol feedbacks. While no hypothesis has been definitively rejected, and no GCM has accurately reproduced all features (e.g., timing, duration, and extent) of any specific megadrought, their persistence suggests a role for processes that impart memory to the climate system (land surface and ocean dynamics). Over the 21st century, GCMs project an increase in the risk of megadrought occurrence through greenhouse gas forced reductions in precipitation and increases in evaporative demand. This drying is robust across models and multiple drought indicators, but major uncertainties still need to be resolved. These include the potential moderation of vegetation evaporative losses at higher atmospheric [CO2], variations in land surface model complexity, and decadal to multidecadal modes of natural climate variability that could delay or advance onset of aridification over the the next several decades. Because future droughts will arise from both natural variability and greenhouse gas forced trends in hydroclimate, improving our understanding of the natural drivers of persistent multidecadal megadroughts should be a major research priority.},

abstract = {The demand for novel molecularly targeted drugs will continue to rise as we move forward toward the goal of personalizing cancer treatment to the molecular signature of individual tumors. However, the identification of targets and combinations of targets that can be safely and effectively modulated is one of the greatest challenges facing the drug discovery process. A promising approach is to use biological networks to prioritize targets based on their relative positions to one another, a property that affects their ability to maintain network integrity and propagate information-flow. Here, we introduce influence networks and demonstrate how they can be used to generate influence scores as a network-based metric to rank genes as potential drug targets.We use this approach to prioritize genes as drug target candidates in a set of ER⁺ breast tumor samples collected during the course of neoadjuvant treatment with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole. We show that influential genes, those with high influence scores, tend to be essential and include a higher proportion of essential genes than those prioritized based on their position (i.e. hubs or bottlenecks) within the same network. Additionally, we show that influential genes represent novel biologically relevant drug targets for the treatment of ER⁺ breast cancers. Moreover, we demonstrate that gene influence differs between untreated tumors and residual tumors that have adapted to drug treatment. In this way, influence scores capture the context-dependent functions of genes and present the opportunity to design combination treatment strategies that take advantage of the tumor adaptation process.Influence networks efficiently find essential genes as promising drug targets and combinations of targets to inform the development of molecularly targeted drugs and their use.},

The variance is modulated due to changes in (1) dry day frequency and (2) maximum daily rainfall intensity. With positive AMV forcing, the upper level warming originating from the increased precipitation over the tropical Atlantic Ocean changes the mean vertical thermal structure over the US continent to a profile less favorable for rain-inducing upward motions. In addition, a northerly low-level dry advection associated with the local overturning leaves less available column moisture for condensation and precipitation. The opposite conditions occur during cold AMV periods.},

We address (1) strategic exploitation of the total range of food resources (wild and cultigens), (2) amelioration of alternative buffering strategies, and (3) impact of household size and composition. These are examined within the context of the cumulative impact of recurrent multiyear stress. The postulated buffering strategies which demonstrated higher probability of success are in agreement with ethnographic descriptions.

abstract = {The transfer of food among group members is a ubiquitous feature of small-scale forager and forager-agricultural populations. The uniqueness of pervasive sharing among humans, especially among unrelated individuals, has led researchers to evaluate numerous hypotheses about the adaptive functions and patterns of sharing in different ecologies. This article attempts to organize available cross-cultural evidence pertaining to several contentious evolutionary models: kin selection, reciprocal altruism, tolerated scrounging, and costly signaling. Debates about the relevance of these models focus primarily on the extent to which individuals exert control over the distribution of foods they acquire, and the extent to which donors receive food or other fitness-enhancing benefits in return for shares given away. Each model can explain some of the variance in sharing patterns within groups, and so generalizations that ignore or deny the importance of any one model may be misleading. Careful multivariate analyses and cross-cultural comparisons of food transfer patterns are therefore necessary tools for assessing aspects of the sexual division of labor, human life history evolution, and the evolution of the family. This article also introduces a framework for better understanding variation in sharing behavior across small-scale traditional societies. I discuss the importance of resource ecology and the degree of coordination in acquisition activities as a key feature that influences sharing behavior.},

As a necessary first step to determine the role of anglers as invasion vectors across a land–lake ecosystem, we investigate their movement potential within Ontario, Canada.

abstract = {Extensive research has documented the importance of social trust for economic development, yet the origins of trust remain largely unexplored. This paper examines the historical relationship between risk, cooperation and the emergence of social trust. I hypothesize that norms of trust developed in preindustrial times as a result of experiences of collective action and mutual insurance triggered by the need for subsistence farmers to cope with climatic risk. These norms persisted over time, even after climate had become largely unimportant for economic activity. I test this hypothesis in the context of Europe combining high-resolution climate data for the period 1500-2000 with contemporary survey data at the sub-national level. I find that regions characterized by higher year-to-year variability in precipitation and temperature display higher levels of trust. Consistent with a theory of insurance through geographic differentiation, I also find that trust is higher in regions with more spatially heterogeneous precipitation. Furthermore, variation in social trust is driven by weather patterns during the growing season and by historical rather than recent variability. These results are robust to the inclusion of country fixed-effects, a variety of geographical controls, and regional measures of early political and economic development.},

abstract = {Introduction to online article: Ecological responses to climatic variability in the Southwest include regionally-synchronized fires and pulses in tree demography (births and deaths). Multi-century, tree-ring reconstructions of drought, disturbance history, and tree demography reveal climatic effects across scales, from annual to decadal, and from local to mesoscale (108 to 1011 m2). Climate-disturbance relations are more variable and complex than previously assumed. For example, regional fires occur during extreme droughts (Figs. 1 and 2), but antecedent wet conditions play a secondary role by regulating accumulation of fuels. Interdecadal changes in fire-climate associations indicate shifts in the strength of ENSO-fire teleconnections during the past three centuries (Swetnam and Betancourt 1990, 1993). High interannual, fire-climate correlations (r = 0.7 to 0.9) during specific decades (i.e., ca. 1740-1780 and 1830-1860) reflect periods of high amplitude in the Southern Oscillation and rapid switching from extreme wet to dry years in the Southwest, thereby entraining fire occurrence across the region (Fig. 3). Weak correlations from 1780 to 1830 correspond with a decrease in SO amplitude or frequency inferred from independent tree-ring width, ice core, and coral isotope reconstructions (Stahle and Cleaveland 1993, Dunbar et al. 1994).},

However, attribution of suboptimal behavior to risk minimization without consideration of the structure of risk and its environmental context obscures the complexity of agricultural decision-making. The productive potential of a prehistoric agricultural system that includes floodwater and dry farming and stream irrigation is modeled using Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis to evaluate whether diversification occurred as a response to population pressure or as a risk buffering strategy. The estimated productive potential of floodwater and irrigation farming is sufficient to have supported the estimated local population, suggesting that risk buffering is a more likely explanation. Floodwater farming and stream irrigation form a dual strategy that is effective at reducing risk. However, the potential of dry farming for subsistence production is insufficient for buffering more than a 2{\%} productive shortfall. We propose that, within this generally risk-averse economy, dry farming was oriented toward the production of nonsubsistence crops such as cotton. $\backslash$nKEY WORDS: risk; diversification; geographic information system; Southwestern prehistory; population pressure.},

abstract = {Archaeologists have regarded social networks as both the links through which people transmitted information and goods as well as a form of social storage creating relationships that could be drawn upon in times of subsistence shortfalls or other deleterious environmental conditions. In this article, formal social network analytical (SNA) methods are applied to archaeological data from the late pre-Hispanic North American Southwest to look at what kinds of social networks characterized those regions that were the most enduring versus those that were depopulated over a 250-year period (A.D. 1200–1450). In that time, large areas of the Southwest were no longer used for residential purposes, some of which corresponds with well-documented region-wide drought. Past research has demonstrated that some population levels could have been maintained in these regions, yet regional scale depopulation occurred. We look at the degree to which the network level property of embeddedness, along with population size, can help to explain why some regions were depopulated and others were not. SNA can help archaeologists examine why emigration occurred in some areas following an environmental crisis while other areas continued to be inhabited and even received migrants. Moreover, we modify SNA techniques to take full advantage of the time depth and spatial and demographic variability of our archaeological data set. The results of this study should be of interest to those who seek to understand human responses to past, present, and future worldwide catastrophes since it is now widely recognized that responses to major human disasters, such as hurricanes, were “likely to be shaped by pre-existing or new social networks” (as reported by Suter et al. (Research and Policy Review 28:1–10, 2009)).},

Extracted Annotations (5/8/2015, 10:50:52 PM)
"As Glowacki ( 2010 , p. 200) pointed out " [c]omplete regional depopulation is not a predestined outcome of drought and poor agricultural yield. " Van West ( 1994 ; see also Ahlstrom et al. 1995 and Billman et al. 2000 ) demonstrated that, despite the regional depopulation, yields could have sustained some of the population in the Mesa Verde region during the drought of the last quarter of the thirteenth century, albeit at lower levels" (p. 34)
"interregional networks (Mills et al. 2013a , b , c )." (p. 35)
"The intensity and extent of social networks has been widely acknowledged in the anthropological literature as providing access to information and resources to minimize risk and uncertainty (Colson 1979 ; DysonHudson and Smith 1978 ; Halstead and O' Shea 1989 ; Wiessner 1977 ). T" (p. 35)
"We use SNA to look at both internal and external ties to understand the social component of regional depopulations as well as to examine how long-distance ties created viable alternatives to staying in place. We argue that regions with relatively low population sizes and relatively closed social networks were especially vulnerable to depopulation. Those regions with comparatively open social networks, or closed networks and large population sizes, were more successful through time." (p. 35)
"Recent research demonstrates that one way that people are able to cope with disasters is by using their social networks to access external help and resources (McMahan 2013 ; Suter et al. 2009 )." (p. 36)
"To compute the embeddedness of a region, we use the external - internal (E - I) index (Krackhardt and Stern 1988 ). This measure quantifies network relations at three scales: population (the entire network), region (sub-sets of the network), and individual (nodes), to examine the level of a region ' s embeddedness in the overall network." (p. 36)
"Since behavior is rooted in networks of interpersonal relations, an examination of the structure of these interpersonal relations provides insight into behavioral patterns (homophily/heterophily). An examination of the changing structure of these interpersonal relations creates insights into behavioral processes (embeddedness/disembeddedness), something that can only be examined with diachronic data." (p. 38)
"Everett and Borgatti ( 2012 ) note that when there are dramatic differences in the numbers of nodes among different groups, it is important to normalize E - I scores." (p. 42)
"Although homophily, the propensity to associate with similar actors or to have more internal than external relationships, has been repeatedly demonstrated in static data, our longitudinal data suggests a different trend, one which shows that the process of embeddedness, or the population level result of increasing heterophily, occurred over time. In fact, this increase through time of a network ' s level of embeddedness (Table 1 ) occurs regardless of whether the network is calculated on binarized (strong ties only) or non-binarized (strong and weak ties) data." (p. 44)
"Additionally, the patterns present at the population, or overall network, level deviate from previously proposed patterns of social interaction that argue for increasing homophily, a pattern that would necessitate increasing disembeddedness at the network level. Instead, we primarily see an increase in embeddedness at the network level, indicating increasing heterophily through time among archaeological sites. At the critical junction where the period of drought occurs (A.D. 1250 - 1300), a shift from a focus on weak external ties to maintain embeddedness to a focus on strong external ties to maintain embeddedness is observed. This is dramatically magnified in later periods, possibly as communities in multiple regions concentrate on expanding social connections through the development of inclusive social institutions that facilitate network embedding. As we will see below, these institutions might be useful in persistence and survival strategies during the environmental downturn." (p. 45)
"Archaeologists have argued for the importance of external ties to increase the variability and availability of resources, particularly in contexts marked by high degrees of spatial and temporal resource patchiness (Cordell et al. 2007 ; Rautman 1993 ). Further, sociologists have argued that such external ties are most useful during periods of crisis if they are firmly established and strong (Krackhardt and Stern 1988 ). It would appear then that the ability of a group (region) to weather a crisis relied not simply on external connections, but on strong external connections ( e.g. , Krackhardt and Stern 1988 ; Uzzi 1996 )." (p. 46)
"Importantly, sociological theorists have argued that, given similar forms of network interaction ( i.e. , similar levels of embeddedness), groups characterized by larger populations will often be less effective at managing crises ( e.g. , Krackhardt and Stern 1988 , p. 129). In a related vein, Duff ( 2000 , 2002 ) and others (Nelson et al. 2011 ; Peeples and Haas 2013 ) have argued that differences in absolute population create structural differences in the ways that populations interact among themselves and with outsiders. Thus, Duff and others suggest that increased population will often correlate with lower embeddedness, which is consistent with the results presented here" (p. 48)
"Zuni had a high degree of internal residential mobility and an extremely flexible settlement system (Schachner 2012 ). Additionally, they were positioned along a gradient in the Southwest where changes in precipitation patterns between summer dominant and summer and winter (bimodal) precipitation patterns were common. As such, they would have had to develop practices well adapted to considerable environmental variability and would have had access to areas marked by local spatial and temporal variability (Hegmon et al. 2014 )." (p. 49)
"In sum, for the E - I index, it appears that while groups with an externally oriented social network are not necessarily good predictors of persistence (since many externally focused groups did not successfully manage the crisis brought on by the thirteenth century drought), consistently internally focused groups are a good predictor of depopulation events" (p. 50)

abstract = {The persistence of small populations is influenced by genetic structure and functional connectivity. We used two network-based approaches to understand the persistence of the northern Idaho ground squirrel (Urocitellus brunneus) and the southern Idaho ground squirrel (U. endemicus), two congeners of conservation concern. These graph theoretic approaches are conventionally applied to social or transportation networks, but here are used to study population persistence and connectivity. Population graph analyses revealed that local extinction rapidly reduced connectivity for the southern species, while connectivity for the northern species could be maintained following local extinction. Results from gravity models complemented those of population graph analyses, and indicated that potential vegetation productivity and topography drove connectivity in the northern species. For the southern species, development (roads) and small-scale topography reduced connectivity, while greater potential vegetation productivity increased connectivity. Taken together, the results of the two network-based methods (population graph analyses and gravity models) suggest the need for increased conservation action for the southern species, and that management efforts have been effective at maintaining habitat quality throughout the current range of the northern species. To prevent further declines, we encourage the continuation of management efforts for the northern species, whereas conservation of the southern species requires active management and additional measures to curtail habitat fragmentation. Our combination of population graph analyses and gravity models can inform conservation strategies of other species exhibiting patchy distributions.},

This study combines archaeological evidence and models of environmental conditions in the eastern Mimbres area of southwest New Mexico to assess the magnitude and timing of food stress from a combination of a period of reduced precipitation and the effects of prolonged hunting and farming activities on the landscape. Results indicate that large game in the area was quite sensitive to hunting pressure, and was locally depleted long before settlement reorganization occurred. Access to arable land was somewhat reduced around the time of settlement reorganization, but productive land remained locally plentiful. Although the settlement reorganization did not improve access to large game or arable land, farmers' perceptions of below-average conditions for agriculture relative to their expectations and past experience would have contributed to decisions to move. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In this paper, we explore the potential implications of geographical variability for the structure of social networks. Beginning with some basic simplifying assumptions, we derive a number of ways in which local network structure should be expected to vary across a region whose population is unevenly distributed. To examine the manner in which these effects would be expected to manifest given realistic population distributions, we then perform an exploratory simulation study that examines the features of large-scale interpersonal networks generated using block-level data from the 2000 U.S. Census. Using a stratified sample of micropolitan and metropolitan areas with populations ranging from approximately 1000 to 1,000,000 persons, we extrapolatively simulate network structure using spatial network models calibrated to two fairly proximate social relations. From this sample of simulated networks, we examine the effect of both within-location and between-location heterogeneity on a variety of structural properties. As we demonstrate, geographical variability produces large and distinctive features in the “social fabric” that overlies it; at the same time, however, many aggregate network properties can be fairly well-predicted from relatively simple spatial demographic variables. The impact of geographical variability is thus predicted to depend substantially on the type of network property being assessed, and on the spatial scale involved.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This paper reports on the first and highly effective use of Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) technology to document Chaco roads, monumental linear surface constructions of the precolumbian culture that occupied the Four Corners region of the American Southwest between approximately AD 600 and 1300. Analysis of aerial photographs supplemented by ground survey has been the traditional methodology employed to identify Chaco roads, but their traces have become increasingly subtle and difficult to detect in recent years due to the impacts of natural weathering, erosion, and land development. Roads that were easily visible in aerial photography and on the ground in the 1980s are now virtually invisible, underscoring the need for new, cutting-edge techniques to detect and document them. Using three case studies of the Aztec Airport Mesa Road, the Great North Road, and the Pueblo Alto Landscape, we demonstrate lidar's unprecedented ability to document known Chaco roads, discover previously undetected road segments, and produce a precise quantitative record of these rapidly vanishing features.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Fifty-two drainage lakes, located in south-central Ontario, Canada, were examined to study the association of isolation- and environment-related factors with fish community composition. Eight quantitative measures of lake isolation were examined, each of which incorporated potential ecological "challenges" that a fish encounters when moving between lakes. A Procrustean approach was employed to assess the degree of concordance between fish assemblage structure, measures of lake isolation and environmental conditions (i.e., lake morphology and water chemistry). Our results revealed a high concordance between patterns in fish community composition and lake isolation and lake morphology at the watershed scale, suggesting that insular and habitat-related factors influence the structure of fish communities. At the scale of the individual lake, this relationship varied greatly, ranging from a strong match of community composition with both spatial and abiotic conditions to communities exhibiting weak association with these conditions. Furthermore, we showed that alternative measures of Lake isolation provide additional insight into potential factors shaping patterns in fish community composition; information not provided using straight-line distances between lakes. Finally, the statistical methodology outlined in this paper provides a robust technique for assessing both the overall association between multivariate data matrices (i.e., landscape or regional scale), as well as facilitating the examination of smaller-scale relationships of individual observations (i.e., local scale).},

More specifically we introduce an elaboration of the Bayesian data augmentation scheme of Koskinen et al. (2010) that uses the exchange algorithm (Caimo and Friel, 2011) for inference for the exponential random graph model (ERGM) where tie variables are partly observed. We illustrate the generating of posteriors and unobserved tie-variables with empirical network data where 74{\%} of the tie variables are unobserved under the assumption that some standard assumptions hold true. One of these assumptions is that covariates are fixed and completely observed. A likely scenario is that also covariates might only be partially observed and we propose a further extension of the data augmentation algorithm for missing attributes. We provide an illustrative example of parameter inference with nearly 30{\%} of dyads affected by missing attributes (e.g. homophily effects). The assumption that all actors are known is another assumption that is liable to be violated so that there are “covert actors”. We briefly discuss various aspects of this problem with reference to the Sageman (2004) data set on suspected terrorists. We conclude by identifying some areas in need of further research.},

Sharing tends to be more socially bounded and restricted in sedentary societies than in societies of mobile foragers. A computer simulation of Hopi (Arizona) agriculture is used to evaluate the effects of sharing on the risk of food shortages and on household survival. Three strategies of household interaction are compared: independent households, pooling among groups of households, and restricted sharing among groups of households. The relative advantages of independence and pooling vary, but restricted sharing is consistently the most successful strategy. In restricted, sharing, households maintain private storage and share only surplus, and sometimes one household fails while other survive.},

All the links between components of this framework can fail and thereby reduce the robustness of the system. We posit that the link between resource users and public infrastructure providers is a key variable affecting the robustness of SESs that has frequently been ignored in the past. We illustrate the problems caused by a disruption in this link. We then briefly describe the design principles originally developed for robust common-pool resource institutions, because they appear to be a good starting point for the development of design principles for more general SESs and do include the link between resource users and public infrastructure providers.},

According to lead-user theory, these users are defined as being ahead of an important market trend and experiencing high benefits from innovating. The present article extends lead-user theory by exploring the antecedents and consequences of consumers' lead userness in the course of three studies on extreme sports communities. Regarding antecedents, it uncovers that field-related variables (consumer knowledge and use experience) as well as field-independent personality variables (locus of control and innovativeness) help explain an individual's lead userness. These variables might therefore be used as a proxy to identify the rare species of lead users. With regard to consequences, it uncovers that lead users demonstrate innovative behavior not only by creating new product ideas but also by adopting new commercial products more heavily and faster than ordinary users. This highlights the idea that lead users might not only be valuable to idea-generation processes for radically new concepts; instead, they might also be relevant to more general issues in the marketing of new products.},

@article{Tippett2008,
abstract = {There are a variety of multivariate statistical methods for analyzing the relations between two datasets. Two commonly used methods are canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and maximum covariance analysis (MCA), which find the projections of the data onto coupled patterns with maximum correlation and covariance, respectively. These projections are often used in linear prediction models. Redundancy analysis and principal predictor analysis construct projections that maximize the explained variance and the sum of squared correlations of regression models. This paper shows that the above pattern methods are equivalent to different diagonalizations of the regression between the two datasets. The different diagonalizations are computed using the singular value decomposition of the regression matrix developed using data that are suitably transformed for each method. This common framework for the pattern methods permits easy comparison of their properties. Principal component regression is shown to be a special case of CCA-based regression. A commonly used linear prediction model constructed from MCA patterns does not give a least squares estimate since correlations among MCA predictors are neglected. A variation, denoted least squares estimate (LSE)-MCA, is suggested that uses the same patterns but minimizes squared error. Since the different pattern methods correspond to diagonalizations of the same regression matrix, they all produce the same regression model when a complete set of patterns is used. Different prediction models are obtained when an incomplete set of patterns is used, with each method optimizing different properties of the regression. Some key points are illustrated in two idealized examples, and the methods are applied to statistical downscaling of rainfall over the northeast of Brazil},

MaxEnt originated in the statistical physics of Boltzmann and Gibbs, as a theoretical tool for predicting the equilibrium states of thermal systems. Later, entropy maximization was also applied to matters of information, signal transmission, and image reconstruction. Recently, since the work of Shore and Johnson, MaxEnt has been regarded as a principle that is broader than either physics or information alone. MaxEnt is a procedure that ensures that inferences drawn from stochastic data satisfy basic self-consistency requirements. The different historical justifications for the entropy S=-∑ipilog⁡pi and its corresponding variational principles are reviewed. As an illustration of the broadening purview of maximum entropy principles, maximum caliber, which is path entropy maximization applied to the trajectories of dynamical systems, is also reviewed. Examples are given in which maximum caliber is used to interpret dynamical fluctuations in biology and on the nanoscale, in single-molecule and few-particle systems such as molecular motors, chemical reactions, biological feedback circuits, and diffusion in microfluidics devices.},

abstract = {How natural selection can promote cooperative or altruistic behavior is a fundamental question in biological and social sciences. One of the persuasive mechanisms is "indirect reciprocity," working through reputation: cooperative behavior can prevail because the behavior builds the donor's good reputation and then s/he receives some reciprocal benefits from someone else in the community. However, an important piece missed in the previous studies is that the reputation-building process requires substantial cognitive abilities such as communication skills, potentially causing a loss of biological fitness. Here, by mathematical analyses and individual-based computer simulations, we show that natural selection never favors indirect reciprocal cooperation in the presence of the cost of reputation building, regardless of the cost-to-benefit ratio of cooperation or moral assessment rules (social norms). Our results highlight the importance of considering the cost of high-level cognitive abilities in studies of the evolution of humans' and animals' social behavior.},

We use social network analysis (SNA) combined with geographic information systems (GIS) at three spatial scales over time in the western U.S. Southwest to show how the same social processes affected network dynamics at each scale. The period we address, A.D. 1200-1450, was characterized by migration and demographic upheaval. The tumultuous late thirteenth century interval was followed by population coalescence and the development of widespread religious movements in the fourteenth through fifteenth centuries. In the southern Southwest these processes resulted in a highly connected network that drew in members of different settlements within and between different valleys. In the northern Southwest networks were initially highly connected followed by a more fragmented social landscape. We examine how different network textures emerged at each scale through 50-year snapshots. The results demonstrate the usefulness of applying a multiscalar approach to complex historical trajectories and the potential for SNA as applied to archaeological data.},

Correlations of western US precipitation with SOI and other indices of tropical El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) processes were much weaker from 1920 to 1950 than during recent decades. This variability in teleconnections is associated with the character of tropical air–sea interactions as indexed by the number of out-of-phase SOI/tropical sea surface temperature (SST) episodes, and with decadal variability in the North Pacific Ocean as indexed by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). ENSO teleconnections with precipitation in the western US are strong when SOI and NINO3 are out-of-phase and PDO is negative. ENSO teleconnections are weak when SOI and NINO3 are weakly correlated and PDO is positive. Decadal modes of tropical and North Pacific Ocean climate variability are important indicators of periods when ENSO indices, like SOI, can be used as reliable predictors of winter precipitation in the US.

Here we introduce a novel approach (Population Graphs) that focuses on the analysis of marker-based population genetic data within a graph theoretic framework. This method can be used to estimate traditional population genetic summary statistics, but its primary focus is on characterizing the complex topology resulting from historical and contemporary genetic interactions among populations. We introduce the application of Population Graphs by examining the range-wide population genetic structure of a Sonoran Desert cactus (Lophocereus schottii). With this data set, we evaluate hypotheses regarding historical vicariance, isolation by distance, population-level assignment and the importance of specific populations to species-wide genetic connectivity. We close by discussing the applicability of Population Graphs for addressing a wide range of population genetic and phylogeographical problems.},

abstract = {Societies frequently generate public infrastructure and institutional arrangements in order to mediate short-term environmental fluctuations. However, the social and ecological consequences of activities dealing with short-term disturbances may increase the vulnerability of the system to infrequent events or to long-term change in patterns of short-term variability. Exploring this possibility requires the study of long-term, transformational change. The archaeological record provides many examples of long-term change, such as the Hohokam who occupied the Phoenix Basin for over a thousand years and developed a complex irrigation society. In the 14th century, Hohokam society experienced a reduction in complexity and scale possibly associated with regional climatic events. We apply a framework designed to explore robustness in coupled social-ecological systems to the Hohokam Cultural Sequence. Based on this analysis, a stylized formal model is developed to explore the possibility that the success of the Hohokam irrigation system and associated social structure may have increased their vulnerability to rare climactic shocks.},

abstract = {Pollen-mediated gene flow is a major driver of spatial genetic structure in plant populations. Both individual plant characteristics and site-specific features of the landscape can modify the perceived attractiveness of plants to their pollinators and thus play an important role in shaping spatial genetic variation. Most studies of landscape-level genetic connectivity in plants have focused on the effects of inter-individual distance using spatial and increasingly ecological separation; yet have not incorporated individual plant characteristics or other at-site ecological variables. Using spatially explicit simulations, we first tested the extent to which the inclusion of at-site variables influencing local pollination success improved the statistical characterization of genetic connectivity based upon examination of pollen pool genetic structure. The addition of at-site characteristics provided better models than those that only considered inter-individual spatial distance (e.g., IBD). Models parameterized using conditional genetic covariance (e.g., Population Graphs) also outperformed those assuming panmixia. In a natural population of Cornus florida L. (Cornaceae), we showed that the addition of at-site characteristics (clumping of primary canopy opening above each maternal tree and maternal tree floral output) provided significantly better models describing gene flow than models including only between-site spatial (IBD) and ecological (Isolation By Resistance) variables. Overall, our results show that including inter-individual and local ecological variation greatly aids in characterizing landscape-level measures of contemporary gene flow.
